1;As everyone writes : excellent;5.0;I don't have much to say about this restaurant that hasn't been said here before. Everybody on this website writes how amazing it is, and you can indeed find really excellent burgers here, with delicate flavours that you usually do not find in a burger. I took the chocolate mousse for dessert, which was fine. Very quick and friendly, attentive service. Not sure this is the best restaurant in Paris, despite its ranking, but this is certainly one of the best for this range of prices, and unquestionably the best burger I've ever eaten in Paris. Therefore I highly recommend it.;sept-20;Il Etait Un Square
1;The best burger!!;5.0;Me and my partner found this restaurant after search on tripadvisor. It met our expectations and more!! We reserved a table and were greeted by such lovely and attentive members of staff. The food came out fast after being seated. This was perhaps the best burger we have both eaten, everything was cooked to perfection and the homemade mayonnaise was delicious. Would definitely recommend to anyone who was visiting Paris!!;août-20;Il Etait Un Square
1;Delicious Burger;5.0;We found this restaurant at trip Advisor. Burger was absolutely delicious, one of the best I’ve had. Very recommended;oct-19;Il Etait Un Square
1;Neighbourhood gem;5.0;We found this restaurant in an effort to get to know the Buttes aux Cailles neighbourhood better on our short weekend trip away post lockdown. And it was a great find! The restaurant is known for unique burgers and tartars. The food is delicious, the pitchers of wine are very well chosen, and the server really enjoys his job. The tiramisu was amazing!;août-20;Il Etait Un Square
1;Burger was absolutely delicious, but;4.0;Burger was absolutely delicious, one of the best I’ve had, however it felt very rushed, we arrived just as they opened and asked for a table for 2, we were asked had we booked, we said we hadn’t, the waiter then proceeded to look round the empty room full of empty tables to try and find us one, he said it should be ok. They also have a great offer on the website and in the window, burger, fries, drink and desert for €20, this however is take out only. As previously mentioned can not fault the burger and it is worthy of 5stars but not the overall experience.;août-20;Il Etait Un Square
1;A really great burger, not;5.0;A really great burger, not too fatty either. The service was very attentive. A bit far maybe but definitely worth it. I’ll be back.;juil-20;Il Etait Un Square

1;Delicious, filling and great service;5.0;I've known about this restaurant for ages, especially as it is so highly rated on trip advisor, but only found it recently.Originally we had planned to get take away, but since it was quiet we decided to eat in. We ate on the terrace because indoor eating was still forbidden at the time, there was a bit of wind, but we managed. Service was wonderful, the owner or the manager at least was friendly and helpful and stayed chatting with us. He ensured we had a great meal. Meanwhile the burgers are excellent, the quality of the ingredients is really there and they were prepared perfectly. We tried the cheddar burger and the blue burger and both were just want we wanted. This restaurant lives up to the hype.;juin-20;Il Etait Un Square

1;Best Burger in Town;5.0;We had eaten at two other burger places prior to finding this location during our two weeks in Paris. The servers were beyond friendly and (I'm assuming) the owner came over to our table and provided some humorous banter prior to the meal. The burgers were not made of your typical ground meat...it was more like ground steak. We asked for well done and recieved a perfectly cooked burger. The fries and salad that came with the burger were also very good. They also provide ketchup and mustard for each of the tables. The prices weren't bit weren't expensive either. We paid around 50 euro for two burger plates, wine, water, and dessert. The dessert was good as well. I had the apple crumble and the wife had the chocolate mousse. All in all one of the best meals we had in Paris.;mars-20;Il Etait Un Square

1;5 star - Reserve a table !!;5.0;Highly recommended !Heard about this place online before we can to Paris so we Pre booked a table. Rocked up to a quiet restaurant thinking we had got the wrong place. Amazing customer service in the mean time. Sat down and not 5 minutes later the restaurant was heaving. The burger was incredible with blue cheese and caramelised onions ooozing out of the side of the bun (and I hate onions) didn’t want it to end!Great job guys and thanks for speaking English for us unintelligent British folk;mars-20;Il Etait Un Square

1;Delightful Dinner;5.0;My wife and I came to Il Etait Un Square based on TA reviews and once again were treated to a gastronomic delight. This is on the surface just a burger joint, but that couldn't be further from what you get. The burgers are just incredible and cooked to perfection, in a manner you wont find anywhere else. They also specialise in steak tartare and the flavours are the heroes in the restaurant. The service is fantastic and all plates are very well priced. All in all, if you eat in Il Etait Un Square, you will leave happy.;févr-20;Il Etait Un Square

1;Listen to the reviews!;5.0;We arrived at Il Etait Un Square expected big things after reading the reviews and we weren't disappointed.We arrived around 1pm on a Saturday and were told politely by the manager that they were very busy so there would unfortunately be a wait (it was a Saturday with school holidays looming, so it was understandable). He was very honest with us & said he did not know how long the wait would be. We decided that we wanted to try the burgers, so went to sit in the nearby park. We returned after 30mins and were pleased to find that they had tables free. The wait staff were very polite to us and spoke good English. they were very welcoming. Our food was prompt and cooked to order (I had the Parisian whilst my girlfriend had the Max). The burgers were large, were clearly handmade and most importantly were well worth the wait. On our way out the manager told us he was very happy to have been able to seat us & this made us feel very good indeed.I would definitely recommend coming here, even if you do have to wait a little bit.;févr-20;Il Etait Un Square

Utterly flavorful and completely delicious.;nov-19;Il Etait Un Square
1;A great evening at a great place;5.0;The decision was easy to make: We've seen the pictures of the burgers and immediately knew, that we have to try this place. We got what we've expected and even more.The staff is very friendly, kind and helpful. They speak good English which is always great!The service was fast and we've received the right amount of attention.We went especially for the burgers, but there is a lot more to discover. We almost got uncertain what to order when we saw the plates of others and read through the menu. It's a pity we have only one stomach... :) But we remained with our original plan and went for the burgers which we didn't regret. They were just as juicy and cheesy as on the pictures. Delicious stuff, so thumbs up!Oh, and as we were chatting, we didn't realize that we were already past closing time. It wasn't intentional, we just completely forgot about time. We were surprized that no one came to our table to say that it's time to leave. That was very kind of them :) So all in all, we highly recommend it to anyone. Just make sure you make a reservation because the place is busy .)Thank you for having us! All the best!Dora and Peter from Budapest;nov-19;Il Etait Un Square

1;A TRUE cheeseburger;5.0;San Francisco natives. Suffice it to say we get to eat some of the best foods in the world but these cheddar burgers are in a unique class of their own. They really put the majority of burgers in the US to shame! The creaminess... Is extraordinary! I'm sad I have to go back to eating normal single slice cheese burgers now. And the owner is so friendly!!! Great atmosphere, great customer service, great food. Go here. You won't be sorry!;oct-19;Il Etait Un Square
1;Best burger ever!;5.0;This is not only the best burger in Paris, it’s the best burger I’ve ever had anywhere! It’s difficult to get to, but definitely worth the effort. Luscious, large patty on a brioche bun, drizzled with the cheese of your choice!! This is a 5-napkin burger! And the owner and staff are delightful......and did I mention the fries are awesome as well?! This is not to be missed!! We took Uber there, then walked to the Pantheon......definitely worth stopping by on your way and you can walk off the calories!;oct-19;Il Etait Un Square
1;Best Burger in Paris;5.0;We ate lunch here on our trip to Paris. Small quaint cafe-style place with very friendly staff. Owner came over to our table and talked to us for 10 to 15 minutes. Burgers were out of this world good and all food served fast and piping hot.;sept-19;Il Etait Un Square
1;For cheeseburgers lovers;5.0;We'd heard about this place from Trip Advisor and decided to go and try it. The quality of the cheeseburgers were fantastic. So good. We fully recommend and definitely will back on our next trip.;sept-19;Il Etait Un Square
1;Best burger in Paris!;5.0;If you really want to eat good burgers, go to this place.Hands down the best burger I ever had in my life!We got to this place around noon, the place was packed but we were seated quickly.It has a nice French atmosphere, but not tourists-french.The menu is simple, with a nice burger selection at really good prices. All the burgers comes with small salad and fries.They are VERY generous with the toppings, and the mayonnaise sauce on the side is heaven!So if you want to eat the best burger in the world (yes, world!) go there, you will not regret it! The staff was really friendly, and if you don't speak french they have an english menu :)I would definitely go there again! I'm really happy we've found this place.;oct-19;Il Etait Un Square
1;You Gotta Eat Here!;5.0;My apologies to John Catucci for plagiarizing the title of his TV show, but . . . I have to admit I was skeptical when my wife told me a burger joint was Trip Advisor rated as the #2 restaurant in Paris out of over 16,000. But, after 2 1/2 weeks in Italy, I was craving a burger.It was almost around the corner from where we were staying, and even though the reviews recommended reservations, we decided to take a chance and just showed up. They found us a table for 5, and the staff were friendly, courteous, outgoing and professional. Burgers, fries and beer were ordered all around, and were quickly served.And what burgers! Big, juicy, tasty and dripping with their own cheese sauce. Amazing! I can't remember when I have enjoyed a burger more. Not even my own homemade burger stand up to these. Served as you like, but recommended medium rare, these are burgers to remember.In Paris? Like burgers? You Gotta Eat Here!;sept-19;Il Etait Un Square
1;Amazing cheeseburgers;5.0;I'd heard about this place and decided to try it. We were pleasantly surprised at the quality of the cheeseburgers. So good. Will go back again.;sept-19;Il Etait Un Square
1;Best burger I've ever had!;5.0;I had the burger of the month (obviously rotates) and my wife had The Cheddar. Our burgers were cooked perfectly cooked and I'd be hard pressed to find a burger I've enjoyed more. The beef was cooked to perfection, veggies were crisp and fresh, bun was fresh from the bakery and the perfect mix of soft and crisp. And the cheese sauce...was out of this world. I'd like to add the fries were perfect and thr atmosphere was incredible but that would just be taking away from the burger which is the real show stealer. If you're in Paris, this place is a must hit!;oct-19;Il Etait Un Square
1;Burgers with an incredible difference!!;5.0;"Its incredible to think that this Restaurant is ranked #2 (by travellers like us) of the 16,500 restaurants in Paris!! And one can get a menu (in English), which describe the relatively inexpensive burgers, including simply amazing vegetarian ""felafel (a ""Mediterranean""/middle eastern favourite) burgers... The meat [probably from French Charolais beef] is superb... and Customers are even asked by the very helpful staff how they would like the burger cooked! The sauces available are also outstanding... and the cheeses [should one desire this added extra] reflect the incredible quality and taste of highly reputed ""french cheeses""! Not to be ignored are the excellent ""french fries"" and the high quality freshly baked buns. Imagine... this restaurant is much more highly ranked than the myriad of restaurants serving very expensive ""French Food""! It is very advisable to make a reservation in advance, This restaurant will not only be ""most memorable""-- but will result in comparing these burgers with other places proving burgers.I hope that this Review is helpful.";sept-19;Il Etait Un Square

1;tasty burgers;4.0;tried to reserve online, didn’t work so went there at 19.00, when restaurant opens and got lucky. owner is friendly and explains to every table their concept and we were not dissapointed. first time someone asks me how i want my burger cooked and first thing that came up to me was “saignant”. my partner asked for “a point” and warned me about my request.. i indeed regretted my choice but the cook did prepare what i asked for. the taste was still very good, would recommend it to everybody but please don’t ask your burger to be cooked “saignant” unless you like your burger to be like “americain” .-);sept-19;Il Etait Un Square

I had the best burger & chips I have ever tasted and would reccommend this to anyone visiting Paris! The service was great too.;sept-19;Il Etait Un Square
1;Their food was as great as they staff;5.0;"We went on a whim without a reservation. (I would recommend making a reservation). This restaurant and their staff was the best. The burger was amazing. Cooked to perfection, topped with unbelievable mixture of cheese, other meat and seasonings. The chicken ""burger"" was less perfect only because of the meat - not the toppings. But since this is a burger/beef place, stick to to beef. What set us over the top was the hospitality. We walked into a full night and the owner or manager went out of their was to accommodate us. Amazing experience and would go back again and again to keep trying new things.";sept-19;Il Etait Un Square

1;Absolutely Fantastic Burgers;5.0;We were in the neighbourhood and decided to give this place a try. So glad we did. Being Canadian we have had our share of burgers, but honestly, these are perhaps the best any of us have ever had. The service is very friendly too. Highly recommended if you are in Paris!Note the online booking system is and will remain down as they are just too busy. Best to call to reserve a table or show up early.;août-19;Il Etait Un Square

1;Wow! Most amazing place.;5.0;We booked online based on the reviews and we were welcomed and offered a range of tables. The waiter went through the whole menu and was fantastic. It was a very hot day 42c and they had some cooking spray for each table to help manage. The food was out of this world and very reasonable €16 for an incredible burger and fries. Superb!;juil-19;Il Etait Un Square
1;Unlike anywhere else;5.0;The reviews are the real deal. We visited many restaurants in Paris, many were good but this was a great experience. The most friendly staff/owner and quick service sets it apart from anywhere else. The Parisian and Max burgers were both delicious... tasted quality beef and needed to eat with a fork and knife due to all the cheese. No doubt why it is now the #1. Thank you for a wonderful evening.;juil-19;Il Etait Un Square
1;Amazing burger;5.0;Great place Great burger , fresh and well prepared tasty and well executed Great people Would visit again and again...;juil-19;Il Etait Un Square
1;Awesome burgers and great hosts!;5.0;We visited here based on the great reviews and it did not disappoint! We had a cheese platter for starter, which was lovely and different burgers for mains. The melted cheese sauce on their burgers is so tasty and the unique meat they use is cooked to perfection and delicious. There is a nice range of french beers and wines on offer as well, which is what everyone wants to see at a good restaurant. A special mention to the staff here who take great care of their customers, including fans of Marcelo Bielsa :-D;juil-19;Il Etait Un Square
1;Great place to eat!;5.0;We had the amazingly well made stake tartare and after some delicious burgers with chips and a salad.The service was excellent and the staff was very welcoming, had a really great time.;juil-19;Il Etait Un Square
1;Really good food + nice hosts :);5.0;Best Burgers we had in a while! The starters (sliced bread with a bluecheese/bacon/onion cream) and also the dessert (warm applecrumple) were delicious too! Also the hosts / waiters were really nice and friendly! Definitely a redo when we are back in Paris :);juil-19;Il Etait Un Square
1;Delicious;5.0;Came to Paris for a getaway from the usual. Found this place and will definitely be returning. The burgers were very good and even had the chance to meet the owner, very humble!;juin-19;Il Etait Un Square
1;Delicious food and friendly waiters;5.0;Burgers were very good. Waiters are very friendly and helpful. They speak English too! Great place for a delicious dinner. Affordable prices and worth the money!;juil-19;Il Etait Un Square
1;Nice burger;4.0;After seeing this restaurant was ranked #1 on TA we were pleased to secure a booking the same evening via our hotel concierge.The establishment is out of the way of the centre of Paris, it took us 30 mins via Uber from the Opera area. We were a little late due to traffic but were seated straight away. The place is not pretentious in any way, there is a relaxed vibe evident in the decor and diners.We had a nice introduction from the very friendly owner/manager who talked us through the different menu items and pointed out some photos. On to the food - the burgers are really nice with the speciality cream of cheese. The buns complement this. The fries are really nice too. The owner also seemed genuinely interested to know whether we enjoyed our food which was good. Despite the above, and not to the detriment of Il Etait Un Square in any way but I am not clear why this is ranked the best place in town (unless there is a particularly high number of burger connoisseurs visiting Paris maybe)! My burger was nice, but I won’t remember it for long.In short - if I was in the vicinity then I would definitely come back, but I’m not sure I would head all the way across the city.;juil-19;Il Etait Un Square
1;Excellent burgers;5.0;Ordered the blue cheese burger with fries. Really excellent burger and large portion of fries. Very nice staff who treated us well. Would definitely go back and try other options as well.;juil-19;Il Etait Un Square
1;Excellent dinner!;5.0;We did not have a reservation, but the owner was able to fit us in which we greatly appreciated! The burgers were so good. They definitely had a unique selection of different burgers to choose from. Our favorites were the Bleu Burger and the Max Burger. You can’t go wrong though. Very quaint,charming, and friendly place. It did not disappoint!;juil-19;Il Etait Un Square
1;Amazing restaurant, Amazing owner!;5.0;Don’t miss out on this awesome restaurant in Paris! This Texas family approves this burger spot! Best burger ever and best service too!;juil-19;Il Etait Un Square
1;Amazing Food, Amazing Service;5.0;Cannot fault as to why this establishment got the number 1 spot in Paris on TA! Well deserving of the spot. The food is amazing and so is the service! It’s quite out of the way of Central Paris but worth travelling down to for their food. The owner has so much passion for their food that he thoroughly explained the menu when we got our table. The food was exquisite and they also provided us a can of mist to cool ourselves down as it was a really hot day in France, even in the evening. That was an extremely gracious touch on their service. Will definitely go here again with my family next time!;juil-19;Il Etait Un Square
1;Top quality European beef (cows) prepared expertly with French cheese and bread;5.0;"The beef is slightly different from that found in USA, the cheese is a lot different and the bread is delicious (not ""just a roll""). Overall, the burgers offer a new and seemingly better tasting twist on American burgers (even expensive burgers in foodie havens in NYC). The staff is very friendly and helpful, the price is very reasonable, the food is delicious, and the place is spotless. A great spot to try a ""French burger"" in Paris (also offers steak tartare burgers if interested- too odd a concept for me).";juin-19;Il Etait Un Square
1;Mr David Harmsworth;5.0;Wow. Can’t fault this restaurant at all. We came late on Thursday evening without booking and they managed to squeeze us in at short notice. The burger was unbelievable and my wife thoroughly enjoyed the pesto ravioli too. Lovely service and the prices were very reasonable. Thank you.;juil-19;Il Etait Un Square
1;Really fun, tasty experience;5.0;The burgers were amazing! The owner was really nice and enthusiastically explained the menu. We really enjoyed this meal - highly recommended!!;juin-19;Il Etait Un Square

1;If I could give this restaurant 100 stars I would;5.0;I can’t tell you how much impressed I am with this restaurant. We were welcomed by the owner who introduced us to the meals from the menu. We tried the burgers ( cheddar and max ) and they were amazing! Very light, juicy, meat and bread was fresh. The girl who served us was very polite and professional and speaks english very good ( you won’t find that in France very often ). I would go there again for sure!Thank you!;juin-19;Il Etait Un Square
1;Highly recommend;5.0;The burgers were delicious. We ordered the Max and the Cheddar. Both were yummy. The servers provided an menu in english and also gave a brief overview of the offerings. We enjoyed our lunch very much!;juin-19;Il Etait Un Square
1;Good meat good burger fast service;5.0;Good quality burgers with a french touch. Fast service with customer attention and lot of varieties of burgers even with vegetarian version. Nice place with easy access and good quality price balance;juin-19;Il Etait Un Square
1;Great Lunch;5.0;Delicious food. Bun was light, high quality meat on the burger. Cheddar was like a cheese whiz but really tasty. Killer fresh cut fries. Very personable owner. I get why their rating is so high!;juin-19;Il Etait Un Square
1;BEST BURGERS IN PARIS///THE WORLD!;5.0;Went here for lunch after reading good reviews and definitely didn't disappoint. The quality of service, food and all round atmosphere were excellent. Location is in a quiet area but not far from all the tourist attractions of Paris. When we arrived we were seated straight away and the waiter explained the menu to us and told us about each burger and steak etc on the menu. The food arrived quick and was of amazing quality and the 3 mini desserts and coffee were also amazing. All for a reasonable price aswell. A must visit if you're in Paris!!!;juin-19;Il Etait Un Square
1;Yummy!;5.0;We traveled on the metro to this place and were so delighted with the location and neighborhood. Very charming restaurant, great service, and wonderful food. Staff were informative and spoke English well. It didn’t disappoint!! Worth the trip!;juin-19;Il Etait Un Square
1;Best Burger;5.0;It’s our anniversary and I wanted a place my burger- loving husband would enjoy. This hit the spot. Thank you once again to Trip Advisor and all the travelers who came here before me. Easy to get to on the Metro. Charming neighborhood. Wonderful wait staff. They are kind and welcoming. Happy to explain the entire menu. I had told my husband we could go to Five Guys once while in Paris. After eating here, my husband said we could skip Five Guys and come back here. Yea! All of their food looks and sounds wonderful. I know my husband will go for a burger next time but I might try something else. I’m sure it will be wonderful!;juin-19;Il Etait Un Square
1;WOW! Best burger anywhere! This is a MUST DO.;5.0;Absolutely amazing! Best burger I have every had! Anywhere! We arrived without really knowing the menu, we made reservations based only on the top trip review rating. I initially was going to order steak but when people around us had burgers delivered I knew instantly I wanted a burger. Do not underestimate this burger as “just another basic burger” - this meal was a full delight.I had the melted cheddar and fries and three days later as I write this review I am smiling huge just thinking about it. We lucked out, may you be as lucky.;juin-19;Il Etait Un Square
1;WOW- NOT TO BE MISSED;5.0;After researching places to eat in Paris this place kept coming up with glowing reviews and boy are they right!! Best burger we have ever tried. We had the Cajan and the Max burger, WOW. My only criticism would be- why are you not in Manchester!!;juin-19;Il Etait Un Square
1;Must Try!;5.0;Had a great experience here, was very easy to get to via the metro. The burger is absolutely phenomenal! If you're a burger person, this is a definitely must try. The owner is funny, and you can tell he cares about how his meat is cooked! You should try to go at 12pm, as soon as they open. By 12:30, the entire place was PACKED.;juin-19;Il Etait Un Square
1;An absolute must-try!;5.0;I had the blue cheese beef burger and it was the juiciest, tastiest thing ever. The blue cheese was a perfect complement.The beef tartare (the garcon) was also amazing - fresh, perfectly seasoned and tastes impeccable.We are considering returning again.;juin-19;Il Etait Un Square
1;Delicious burger;5.0;Was missing burgers so stopped by here on recommendation, quality of beef was wonderful and the staff friendly.;mai-19;Il Etait Un Square
1;Absolutely amazing steak tartare and rare burgers!;5.0;"We're foodies and love to try different and unique places. From bistros to 3-Michelin star establishments. One of our favourite foods is steak tartare. And medium-rare burgers if you can get them (and trust the source). Well, we decided to try ""Il Etait un Square"" based on the reviews. And we're very glad we did. Literally the best steak tartare we ever tasted. And the medium-rare burger was equally as good. Probably partially due to the breed of cow used (Aubrac), but mostly due to the skill of the chef. I won't even mention the deserts (which are also very good) - equal to some of the better Parisian restaurants. Located in a pleasant, uncrowded neighbourhood. Finally, the staff was very accommodating - offering to speak French if I wished (sometimes, I try) - but they were happy to speak English, too. And most congenial. Highly recommended!";juin-19;Il Etait Un Square
1;Wonderful Restaurant!;5.0;We were here as the conclusion of our paris journey and were thoroughly satisfied. The boss and his staff were very friendly, courteous and helpful. The food was great in every respect. Very fresh, incredibly tasty and large portions. And all this for a very fair price, especially for Parisian conditions. We will definitely come back!;juin-19;Il Etait Un Square
1;Tres Bien;5.0;Very good food, number one in Paris and we highly recommend a visit to this resturant.Very friendly staff, great food;juin-19;Il Etait Un Square
1;The most yummy burgers in Paris;5.0;I love their burgers, done the right way with to hassle or shortcuts. Just good tasting juicy burgers that you'll love.;juil-18;Il Etait Un Square
1;Outstanding Burger!;5.0;You can tell when eating here that the Owner takes great care in the quality of his menu. He personally seems to check on every table and there is a lot of pride in this burger. You can tell the meat is freshly ground and is made to order anyway you would like it. The flavors are outstanding!;mai-19;Il Etait Un Square
1;Simply best Burger;5.0;Friendly welcome, clear menu, tasty & quality meat, timed service and excellent preparation create a perfect blending to make me thinking that I had last night one of best burger in Europe. Ahh they speak an excellent English a rare skill in Paris.;mai-19;Il Etait Un Square

1;Best burger ever!!;5.0;Wow!! This place is the real deal - great ambiance, friendly service from a team who really know how to do a fabulous burger (and all the other food looked great). Fresh ingredients- high quality beef. We walked 3 miles from our apartment in Eiffel Tower area taking in the sights as we thought it would be worth it - it was! Loved this place and would make the trip here next time I am in Paris.;mai-19;Il Etait Un Square
1;Excellent taste, better service and kindness!;5.0;Try hamburgers, all are good and tasty, portions are very reasonable. Personnel is so nice and kind, they speak many languages and explain you the menu. It’s worth it to cross the city and eat here!;mai-19;Il Etait Un Square
1;From Guatemala, enjoyed fantastic food;5.0;GREAT hamburgers and service. Both the food and the attention were excellent, they add some delicious cheese to the hamburgers depending on what you order and it gives them a unique touch. Will recommend 100% even if you have to move a little far away from the Eiffel Tower.;mai-19;Il Etait Un Square
1;Burger;5.0;I think this is the best burger I ever had in Paris. Meat was delicious. Bread very good too. Short waiting time. Excellent service. Staff speaks English. I would definitely go back;mai-19;Il Etait Un Square
1;Delicious;5.0;This might have been the best burger I have ever had. Me and my girlfriend will be dreaming of them back in England.;mai-19;Il Etait Un Square
1;Good burgers;5.0;This restaurant provides great value for money. My cheese burger was cooked to perfection. The beef, the bun, the cheese all melted in the mouth. My friend's steak tartare was good too. The fat and the meat was well mixed and portioned.;avr-19;Il Etait Un Square
1;Neighborhood spot - Best City Meal - World Class Service;5.0;My lovely wife found this place because she knows how I love burgers. Burgers in Paris were fine, but no performances worth mentioning. UNTIL NOW. this burger felt classic with very Parisian notes complementing each bite. Above and beyond that, the owner is friendly and the staff works hard to make you feel at home. We stepped in with no reservation (not recommended based on how quickly the restaurant filled up) but he made it work and didn't make us feel like the imposition we may have been, SO GREAT.;mai-19;Il Etait Un Square
1;Best burgers;5.0;These burgers were amazing. I recommend the max burger. Cheese was excellent! 10/10!!!!! Would go back.;mai-19;Il Etait Un Square
1;Great tasting burgers;5.0;The burgers were great and we enjoyed ourselves at the restaurant. The servers were very helpful and food was served super fast! You can also take a walk in the park opposite after your meal.;avr-19;Il Etait Un Square
1;Dull and vague tasting burger.;3.0;We were expecting the best burgers in the world since that is what we read about the place but the burgers were actually under seasoned and kind of dull tasting. The blue cheese sauce on my burger was good but it had kind of a vague taste. But maybe I feel this way because where i come from we have amazing burgers. The service was kind of uncomfortable because the owner was there and you could see how much he was overdoing it. Also we were on a table with another couple witch was okay except i could hear everything they were saying and experience their whole evening witch was not so fun. And also it was so tight that it was hard to get out of my seat to go to the bathroom. But the food was okay and the service was also okay. So yeah the whole experience was average.;janv-19;Il Etait Un Square
1;When in Paris, you must visit!;5.0;The owner is so nice! Does everything in his power to make you feel like home, presents the menu, asks where your from and in our case even spoke a few frases in swedish. The burgers are juicy and cheesy. Great price aswell!;mai-19;Il Etait Un Square
1;Simply Amazing;5.0;This Is our first trip to Paris. My husband looked on TripAdvisor for places to eat for lunch and this place got great reviews. We love burgers and Tartare’s and this place definitely raises the bar. We wish we could’ve tried everything on the menu. We got the cheddar burger and the tartare gascon which tasted amazing. We will definitely return the next time we are in Paris.;mai-19;Il Etait Un Square
1;Back again...;5.0;Our favorite restaurant so far! Before going to Village Nature we decided to go Il était un square and have a lovely burger! Gerard and Nicolas thank you again it was delicious!;avr-19;Il Etait Un Square

1;The reviews about the burgers are true!;5.0;We visited following the reviews we saw on here and were glad that we did. The welcome, the service and the food were really good. It was certainly worth the metro ride out.;avr-19;Il Etait Un Square
1;Like eating gourmet burgers in your best friend's house!;4.0;"Based upon the numerous positive reviews, we had to give this a go. What really makes this place a standout is the service and hospitality. With a group of 9 ranging in ages from 74 to 7 months, anyone who can tackle all the personalities and questions with a smile and several jokes/chuckles deserves a medal. And then the food! Because of the comfortable atmosphere created by the staff/owners, it makes the burgers all the better. My two kids had the chicken skewers which were so tender and full of flavor. The burgers melted in your mouth. Quite honestly, the general consensus was that the burgers were slightly bland for our collective tastes (my father asked them to spice up his burger and that was ""solved"" by sprinkling some spice as opposed to putting it in the meat), but one cannot question the quality of cooking and ingredients. All in all, it was a really great meal and would recommend it to anyone who has a chance to dine here.";avr-19;Il Etait Un Square
1;Perfect relaxed meal;5.0;Understated cosy restaurant just off the Place D italie , Small menu , very well expained and did not dissapoint. Fantastic food cooked to perfection at a very resonable price. A must for any burger/tartare lovers whilst in the 13th;mai-19;Il Etait Un Square
1;Lovely meal with excellent service;5.0;We looked at reviews on Trip Advisor for restaurants close to our hotel. This was a fabulous find. The service was so welcoming and the staff were keen to make sure the food was to our liking. The menu was explained very well. We all ate burgers and didn't regret them, they were the best we have ever had. The meat was cooked perfectly and the sauces that came with them were delicious. The chips were good too. The food came quickly, the desserts were also delicious.;avr-19;Il Etait Un Square
1;Average;3.0;After reading all the positive reviews I felt like I had to eat here. Service was fast and everyone was friendly! The food, a hamburger and Cajun chicken sandwich was just average at best. Way over priced in my opinion. Overall Good but not a place I would recommend as a 'can't miss.';avr-19;Il Etait Un Square
1;Simply perfect : very good, fresh food, very good burger, sympathic and clean;5.0;Just a perfect restaurant ! Fresh food, Best ever burger I ate since I came from US. Very sympathic persons who are doing their best to offer you a very pleasant moment. Devil is in the details : 4 different tomatoes in the chesse salad : red, old red, green and yellow. Restaurant is clean, forks, plate, glass, all is checked and cristal clear. But again, the best moment : while opening the mouse to eat this cheese cream burger !I love it(les Niçois);avr-19;Il Etait Un Square

1;EXCELLENT SERVICE! EXCELLENT SERVICE!!!;5.0;We made reservation for 5 people there and ate there tonight. The servers and owner, Gerard, were all super attentive and friendly. Gerard, the owner went from table to table giving detailed information about the whole menu which was quite thoughtful. We are Americans and he explained it in detail in English. You can tell he is vested in his restaurant and patrons. Our table ordered five dishes. 1x Le Bleu burger mid-rare, 1x Le Bleu chicken sandwich, 1x Le Max burger, chicken skewer dish and a Ravioli. The burgers came out hot and juicy and delicious and the table loved them. The chicken sandwich was great too. I think it might have had some bacon but not sure. My wife ordered the chicken skewers and they were delicious and perfectly cooked. My raviolis were not bad but had almost no sauce on them. I left most of it and did say anything. Gerard came to check on all of us and saw that we had enjoyed the food. He saw that I had most of my raviolis on the plate. He asked if I didn’t like them and I told him that I did not and he offered to make them for me again. I said no thank you and he insisted and told me if I didn’t let him remake them for me he would take it off the bill. I opted to get the chicken skewer dish instead. It came out quickly and it was delicious. As a former restauranteur myself, and well travelled eater, I was blown away how much he cared about making his customers happy. Seriously, one of the best places I have been for customer service and the food was right there with the service. Keep doing what you are doing Gerard!! You’re the man! They are know for their burgers and steak tartare specially. We will be back to try more of this place. it was very reasonably priced! Oh, amazing Tiramisu and excellent chocolate mousse!;mars-19;Il Etait Un Square

Staff were superb, multilingual and it was very good value too. Great place!;janv-19;Il Etait Un Square
1;Burger heaven!;5.0;Wouldn’t classify this place as a steakhouse. Burgers and tartare are the main menu items. Delicious burgers and a variety of choices to satisfy meat lovers and vegetarians.;janv-19;Il Etait Un Square
1;Amazing food;5.0;Went here for dinner last night, and despite our poor French we got amazing service followed by delicious food! Both had burgers and dessert which blew us away, not to mention the service was impeccable. Our favourite place to eat in Paris, would recommend thoroughly!;févr-19;Il Etait Un Square
1;Superb food. superb service;5.0;My friends and I were all in Paris for the evening, having traveled from across the world to be together. This was the perfect restaurant for us to choose - we received a wonderful welcome (in French and in English) and were able to choose from the short but perfect menu.You need to love hamburgers or tartare to enjoy eating here (Although there are other dishes on the menu, these two simple dishes are what makes this place special). Quite the best tartare I have ever enjoyed - simply presented and delicious.I recommend without hesitation!;févr-19;Il Etait Un Square
1;24th Birthday;5.0;We visited here on Saturday 26th, we got there quite late (around 9pm) and had read that they shut at 9.30 so was expecting to be told we couldn't eat. However they welcomed us with open arms.Everyone was so friendly and the food was amazing.We had the cheddar burger and the monthly special which were lovely! Also had the apple crumble and the panna cotta.Would definitely recommend!!;janv-19;Il Etait Un Square
1;The best hamburger + service ever!;5.0;We really enjoyed the staffs’ warm welcome and the hamburger! Everyone was so friendly and explained all the menu for us!Would totally recommend!;janv-19;Il Etait Un Square
1;Burgers with a difference!;5.0;Brilliant service. We even tipped! We rarely tip unless the service is impeccable. Classic Brit. Great food and the burgers are cooked to perfection. Eat here, you will not regret it!;janv-19;Il Etait Un Square
1;Jamie;5.0;We booked this little restaurant whilst viewing the Effiel tower and was about 30mins travel but heard great things. We turned up super early and they welcomed us with open arms. This restaurant didn’t disappoint, it was amazing, the stuff super friendly and the owner or manager is obviously very passionate about his job which rubbed on us loads. We felt very welcome and our stomachs felt even better!!;janv-19;Il Etait Un Square
1;Amazing;5.0;Made the trip down here for lunch on our last day in Paris after reading the reviews on Trip Advisor & am so glad we did. The food is amazing, cooked perfectly & probably one of the best burgers I have had! The 2 owners were also both very friendly & helpful, - they both spoke English & explained the menu to us. They even gave us complimentary drinks after our meal even though it was past the restaurant closing time! Amazing food & fantastic service, I would highly recommend this restaurant & if we are ever back in Paris, would certainly be coming back here.;janv-19;Il Etait Un Square
1;Friends gathering;5.0;very nice place, with friendly people.  Food was really tasty !  Highly recomended for burgers and tartare;janv-19;Il Etait Un Square
1;Amazing Food and Hospitality;5.0;My partner and I were searching for a place to eat our first night in Paris and we were very intimidated by trying to speak French. So after seeing great reviews for this place, we decided to give it a try! We are so happy we chose this restaurant as our first meal in Paris! The staff were very kind and accommodating and the food was even better! Easily the best burger I’ve ever had. There’s nothing like it back home so you have to try it while you’re here! If we’re ever in Paris again, this will absolutely be on our itinerary again!;janv-19;Il Etait Un Square
1;The perfect bite;5.0;We can all the way from Eiffel tower to this restaurant as a result of the good reviews here.The staff is kind and very welcoming, the area is quite and pleasent and the hamburgers - OMG.Will definitely come back running.;janv-19;Il Etait Un Square
1;Georgia;5.0;One of the best burger, I ever tried You wont regret. We had max burger and cheddar burger, both perfectly cooked!!! Georgia;janv-19;Il Etait Un Square
1;A neighborhood gem;5.0;Who would have thought a burger could be elevated to gourmet status? You would not happen upon this welcoming restaurant by accident, as it is in a less touristy neighborhood. And yet, glowing reviews prompted us to make reservations and seek it out. The burgers are huge and tasty, and the tartare exceptional. The staff was very friendly and helpful, and we felt relaxed and comfortable. It was perfect for our first night in Paris;janv-19;Il Etait Un Square
1;We had great burgers and an amazing evening;5.0;We booked a reservation for 3 and all of us had different burgers. All the burgers were soooo delicious. My boyfriend had to order another one because he just fell in love with the food. We want to come back and eat those amazing burgers. The service was amazing as well.;janv-19;Il Etait Un Square
1;Great taste burgers;5.0;Really super delicious burgers: book a table in advance as the place is full all the time. Friendly staff, caring attitude, which is not so common in Paris... however, I didn't like their ketchup - Heinz could have been better :) creamy cheese - yummy thing that goes even better than real cheese.;janv-19;Il Etait Un Square
1;Excellent hamburgers, but not only;5.0;I have tried a visit to this place, after reading the excellent reviews, on one of the not so frequent evenings I wanted a burger.The result was absolutely outstanding, not only because the excellent staff and a stroke of luck got me a table despite the fact that the place is normally quite crowded (a reservation is definitely a good idea, especially for more than two people), but because I discovered that, besides the several delicious burgers, this place serves equally tempting tartare steaks, which I am going to sample during my next visit, so more to come shortly.;janv-19;Il Etait Un Square
1;Excellent food and service!;5.0;Very friendly and welcoming staff. We were given a full explanation and recommendations from the menu. Service was fast and the burgers were the best we’ve tried so far! Highly recommend this place. Saludos de los Peruanos!;janv-19;Il Etait Un Square
1;Exceptional food and hosts;5.0;Welcomed by enthusiastic hosts and immediately given a thorough and interesting tour of the menu. The burger was perfectly cooked and the little desserts were gorgeous - a truly unique experience!;juil-18;Il Etait Un Square
1;Welcoming and delicious!;5.0;We visited with a baby and they were incredibly accomodating and friendly to him. Food was fantastic and service was wonderful. They even have suggestions for other places to visit in Paris.;sept-18;Il Etait Un Square
1;Great Burgers;5.0;I was greeted and given an explanation of the menu. Really nice to hear where the burger comes from and that the buns are freshly made. Both of ours burgers tasted amazing and the tiramisu was the best my girlfriend had ever had!! Would recommend anyone visiting Paris to stop here. However make sure you book as it is unlikely you will get in otherwise.;janv-19;Il Etait Un Square
1;Beautiful x;5.0;The staff were extremely friendly, explained everything in English, the food was served quickly and the burgers were absolutely delicious. Slightly out of the centre but well worth the journey and only a two min walk from the metro. All round amazing service - would definitely recommend.;janv-19;Il Etait Un Square
1;Excellent Experience;5.0;We visited this spot back in September. The food was excellent and the service was wonderful. We were visiting from Washington DC with some friends who lived in France and even our friends who were from France were amazed by the quality of the food. Would high recommend!;sept-18;Il Etait Un Square
1;Outstanding;5.0;We had an excellent meal at this restaurant .The owner described in detail all burgers on the menu and the cheese sauce which accompanied each burger .The food was delicious ,as was the Edelweiss Beer Great food & service Well worth a visit;déc-18;Il Etait Un Square
1;Five Stars;5.0;Found it on TripAdvisor as it had 2000 review and a 5 star rating, so we went there by scoot scoot cost us 4 euro and it could possiblythe best 4 euros I have ever spend to go to possibly the best burger place in the whole of France, the staff are very welcoming and lovely, service was brilliant, food was even greater. Overall 5 stars very pleased.;déc-18;Il Etait Un Square
1;Great Hamburgers;5.0;Really good hamburgers and desserts, very nice and helpful staff, deserve the high rating. Highly recommend to visit and enjoy a quality burger here.;déc-18;Il Etait Un Square
1;Perfect burgers & great service;5.0;We came here for burgers after having read great reviews online, and the place exceeded our expectations! The staff was very welcoming and attentive, and always available for refills or if we had any questions. The burgers were really good, and the suggested wine pairing was good. I can recommend this place to anyone, burger lover or not!;déc-18;Il Etait Un Square
1;Excellent choice;5.0;"We are two Greek girls and we just came home after our delicious meal! The cosy restaurant is totally near to the metro stasion! Very good thing for tourists like us! The Armenian owner was very hospitable and polite! The burgers were ""délicieux"" and veeeery big! Moreover the two waiters were very kind and friendly! Especially the sweet girl! Also the prices were very good!I totally recommend it! Efxaristo!";déc-18;Il Etait Un Square
1;Dinner;4.0;Lovely restaurant with a very welcoming service. Everything on the menu was explaining to us as we sat down. The prices are reasonable too for Paris. Myself and my girlfriend both got the rib eye steak. The cut of steak wasnt the best but was cooked decently. I would recommend any tourist in the area give this place a go for lunch or dinner.;déc-18;Il Etait Un Square
1;Delicious Burgers;5.0;We found this delightful little restaurant because of its fantastic reputation and it did not disappoint! It was very busy and we were lucky enough to grab the last table at lunch. The burgers are out of this world. The service is fantastic. It was a really enjoyable meal in a great atmosphere. All very reasonably priced as well!I’ve eaten plenty of burgers in my time and this is by far one of the best.Would thoroughly recommend eating here!;déc-18;Il Etait Un Square
1;Great for lunch;4.0;Great place for lunch. Very friendly and efficient service from owner/ staff. Did not expect to be eating burger and fries in Paris but they were terribly good !;déc-18;Il Etait Un Square
1;Best place for burger meal;5.0;We came there first time and the workers were really nice and kind. The food is excellent and.Definitely a Must go place.;déc-18;Il Etait Un Square
1;Excellent Burgers, Friendly Service;5.0;The restaurant delivers excellent hambuger creations with exceptionally freindly service. The salads and soup are equal to the burgers, and may exceed them in their presentation. The menu is priced consistently with city prices. The atompshere is very casual and the decor is more family diner than french bistro. This, however, is what makes is special: great comfort food and friendly service in a family setting. Highly recommended for families and burger gourmands.Reservations are required at peak times, which is mostly a function of a small space and high demand. Parking is limited, but a metro stop is nearby.;déc-18;Il Etait Un Square
1;Hurt by expectations;3.0;I found this place by looking for the top restaurants on TripAdvisor, and my judgement is clearly affected by the expectation I had going in.The staff is superb. Really quick and attentive, explaining the menu in detail. Good and fun communication, and a easy going mood and vibe. Until you ask for the bill. That process takes time.The burger is, sorry to say, a bit tasteless. I assume the clean meat, and lack of fat, is at fault. The meat/fat ratio made the burger a little boring. Combined with a blue cheese cream not really tasting anything at all like blue cheese, I was a little disappointed.The fries were sloppy and soft. Not crispy.Chocolate mousse did not really taste anything like chocolate. Good consistency on the mousse, though.The waiter could know more about the beers on the menu. I expect clear reccomendations from a place rated this high.All in all, this is just another burger. Burgers are good. This one is too. Just don't expect to have your mind blown away;déc-18;Il Etait Un Square
1;Delicious!;5.0;Burgers were cheesy and delicious! Service was great, our server was super friendly. Would absolutely recommend.;déc-18;Il Etait Un Square
1;Great;5.0;Probably some of the best burgers I've ever had, the ingredients are high quality, the fries also taste really good. I've been there a couple of times now and all my visitors that I brought there loved it! The staff is always friendly and helpful.The burgers with fries and salad are 14 euros which seems very fair.;nov-18;Il Etait Un Square
1;More than perfect.;5.0;I came here because I craved a burger and this place did not disappoint. I ordered a burger with pork the first time unknowingly and without hesitating they happily got me a new burger. The burger was cooked perfectly and lived up to my craving. Definitely a great place to go solo or with your partner or as a family. Great venue, great burgers, Wonderful staff. 11/10!!!;nov-18;Il Etait Un Square

Friendly personel welcomed us, and as we had made no reservation, tried to find us a table. After max 10 minutes of wait we were seated and the owner explained the menu of great authentic French ingredients. We enjoyed our burgers, the tiramisu desert, and the wine.;nov-18;Il Etait Un Square

We were first in but the place soon filled. Salads were simple (&perfect) and the Maison foi gras was sensational (it came with its own wine ). Shared a blue cheese burger which was cooked perfectly. I ordered “a little more rare than medium rare & they nailed it. The Languedoc was recommended and was perfect, as was the complementary wine with the foi gras. The service?? Fantastic, treated like family, hope you are to.;oct-18;Il Etait Un Square

1;NOT disappointed!!;5.0;Amazing!! We made a hopeful attempt to see if we could squeeze in on a busy night with no reservations. Couldn’t have wished for more! We definitely got lucky to get a table, but were still warmly greeted by the owner and felt very welcomed. The food was mouth watering. As avid travelers to many parts of the world, all of us agreed that these may be the best burgers we have ever tried. Tried the chicken burger and the blue. Delicious!!! Impressed by the food and the phenomenal service. What a treat!!;oct-18;Il Etait Un Square
1;Burgers & Beers;5.0;Helpful staff, very attentive. The burgers are up with the best we've had - classic cheese was our favourite. Desserts are worth a try too. A must visit, I wanted to return but told I needed to try somewhere different by the other half!;oct-18;Il Etait Un Square
1;Amazing Chicken!!!!;5.0;In Paris for our honeymoon and as a non-beef eater, wasn’t very excited when my husband was craving a burger for dinner. I found this place on Trip Advisor for him and since it had good reviews elsewhere, we decided to give it a try. Small, quaint place with a simple relaxed atmosphere. My husband got a burger and I reluctantly ordered the Chicken Kabob. I say reluctant because anywhere that we have gone for burgers and I have ordered chicken it always comes out dry, bland and underwhelming. WHOA was I surprised with Il Etait Un Square! The chicken was probably the best I have ever had in my life (and I’d consider myself a bit of a foodie). It was cooked to perfection, moist and flavored to the very center with generous sizes on the skewers. The owner said they use a combination of spices brought in from Bulgaria and marinate the chicken for 24 hours. It was fantastic!!!!! While the burgers may draw you in, definitely give the chicken a try! It was perfection!;oct-18;Il Etait Un Square
1;Hidden gem for great food;5.0;After a couple of attempts we finally got to eat at Il Etait Un Square. It was well worth the effort. Service wise it could not be faulted. The owner was happy helpful and enthusiastic about his restaurant, his food and the people who came to eat. The staff were extremely helpful and seemed to be enjoying working. The food catered for the diverse tastes and needs of the group. They catered for vegetarians and vegans as well as us meat eaters. That is not something you can say about a lot of restaurants in France. Not only that but the food was really tasty as well. They specialise in burgers and tartars;oct-18;Il Etait Un Square
1;Best burger in France!;5.0;The buns were homemade, the beef was local, and the cheese just melted in your mouth! Amazing service and very friendly staffs~ I love this place!;sept-18;Il Etait Un Square

1;Cool ambience, great dinner;5.0;We found this restaurant from an earlier TripAdvisor review, and checked it out. It’s a cool and hip place with great food and service. It’s specialties are burgers with great cheeses added (if desired). They have at least 8 different types of burgers and the same number of choices for steak tartar. My wife had a burger with a blue cheese, while I had the Shogun tartar steak, which had wasabi and sesame added - excellent. All washed down with a a nice rosé. We finished with a a café gourmand, which gave us 4-5 choices of desserts to share. Cost - around €55, so very reasonable. Well worth trying if you’re in the Montparnasse area.;sept-18;Il Etait Un Square

The waiters were really nice and the hamburguers were great!! They had some kind of problem with the kitchen and we had to wait a little for the food to be served, but the wait was worrh it!

1;Warm welcome, excellent food, and service;5.0;When our party of 4 walked in we received a very warm welcome from a gentleman who seemed like the manager. Seemed like a popular place for locals and they like to eat late so the place filled up around 8:30pm. I ordered a cheeseburger and it was so juicy, cheesy, and scrumptious. The fries were on point, too. The waitress was so nice and despite being super busy, she took several pictures for us, of our table. My one and only complaint is that the bottled ketchup they offer is more sugary than I'm used to. I would suggest a different brand or maybe they can make their own. Dessert offerings are tasty, as well. Next time I'm in Paris I'm definitely going here again.;mai-18;Il Etait Un Square
1;Great burgers!;5.0;Wow, this was the best burger I ever had!It was Made with love and care and all personnel showed that same love and care for cooking and making sure guests have a great time.Thanks a lot!Hope to see you again soon;août-18;Il Etait Un Square
1;You get what you pay for!;5.0;Superb. One of the best burgers I’ve ever eaten. Excellent service and pleasant drinks. I’ll return here next time I’m in Paris and feel carnivorous. The place was very busy, but, that can only be a good sign!;août-18;Il Etait Un Square
1;BEST BURGERS!;5.0;By far the BEST burgers my fiancé and I have ever had to date. The house made crème de frômage definitely exceeded our expectations and the portions were massive! My fiancé enjoyed the trio sample dessert which allowed us to try almost every dessert but the panna cotta definitely left a lasting impression on our taste buds! SO GOOD! I enjoyed one of my favourite desserts, the tiramisu which was really good! Almost as good as the tiramisu we enjoyed in Ravello, Italy!I must mention how AMAZING the ketchup was! I don’t even like ketchup on my fries but this ketchup is unlike anything we have in Canada! Seems to be a popular spot for tourists as most (if not all) patrons were from abroad but, definitely deserving of the title #1 restaurant in Paris on Trip Advisor!;juil-18;Il Etait Un Square
1;As good as it looks!;5.0;I decided to go to this restaurant based off the picture of the delicious looking burger- I was not disappointed! The burger was delicious, and my girlfriend really enjoyed her salmon tartare as well.The staff kindly explained the menu when we sat down and were very attentive and friendly. Great music playing as well. We were there for lunch and it was a very relaxed atmosphere. Prices were reasonable. This Washington D.C burger fan was very happy with his visit!;juil-18;Il Etait Un Square
1;Excellent;5.0;Very friendly and pleasant people and very tasty food!We really enjoyed our meal😀From two greek tourists🇬🇷;juil-18;Il Etait Un Square
1;I don't get the hype either;3.0;On the plus side, the service is excellent and the prices are reasonable. Also, the fries are excellent. But we go to burger restaurants for burgers. The burger itself was ok (I will give an extra point for the high effort and uniqueness). The biggest problem was the bun was horrible. Overall it was just ok. Way overhyped.;juin-18;Il Etait Un Square
1;Incredible but must have a reservation!;5.0;We arrived at 8:30pm but since we didn’t have a reservation the owner said we would have to wait about an hour. Since there is a park across the street we waited there. We had a hamburguer, steak and apple crumble for dessert. Everything was delicious, specially the apple crumble, it was the best I’d ever had!! And the service was also excelente the owner and the girls really made an effort yo understand us and give us their best attention.Totally recommended but make sure to have a reservation!;juil-18;Il Etait Un Square
1;Hamburgers in Paris? YES!;5.0;If someone told me that the most memorable food in Paris for me would be hamburgers, I might call them crazy. But it turned out to be true. Their hamburgers are to die for - juicy, so flavorful,made from freshest meat, with excellent condiments. Their ketchup is nothing like the one we have in Canada/States. Their desserts are heavenly too! The service is simple, but very friendly. They meet you with a smile and see that all your needs are met. They do not pretend to be a high cuisine place, but give you mouth-watering food.;juil-18;Il Etait Un Square
1;It’s true!;5.0;Wary of the hype on this restaurant we nevertheless paid a visit as it was a walk from our accommodation. The welcome was hearty despite our turning up early and we were served with a very memorable meal. It specialises in hamburgers and tartares, the meat comes from a local butcher and the burger buns from a local baker. Tender and tasty not even begin to describe our food. Would definitely come back here again!;juil-18;Il Etait Un Square
1;Great spot for families!;5.0;Wonderful experience. So friendly. Amazing food. Next to park that is fun for kids. Would highly recommend.;juil-18;Il Etait Un Square
1;Wonderful;5.0;Tartare and beef. Mmmm. Very hospitable too. Next to a park, which is nice. Owner was very nice. French fries great. Other patrons friendly as well.;juil-18;Il Etait Un Square
1;I don't get the hype.;2.0;Honestly our experience was average at best. We didn't want to order beef, so I ordered a chicken burger and my girlfriend ordered a hamburger of the month (salmon). My Chicken burger lacked flavor, the bread wasn't good and the fries looked like they were refried. My girlfriends salmon burger said it had avocado puree, but it was just an avocado cut in half (not even ripped), also it said it had pink berries on her burger and we spotted 0. The staff is nice but this is very far from a 5* burger house. Maybe the beef burger is nice, but our experience wasn't nice and we wouldn't recommend this place.It was sad sitting on the table waiting for an awesome burger and all it was served was disappointment.;juil-18;Il Etait Un Square
1;Yummines!!!;5.0;Came here on Bastille day! (July 14) The food is truly amazing! We got a cheddar burger and the French burger (no bun w/ a fried egg) and one of the steak tartar’s (we ate it all and could not breathe after)! But that’s how good it was! They have a special cheese that’s melted that comes with all the burgers and that’s what makes it so special! The staff is super friendly and helpful! They made sure to tell us that we can also modify any of our orders! Must go if you’re in Paris, and you love hamburgers and meat!;juil-18;Il Etait Un Square
1;Patron refused to serve us at 25 minutes before closing;1.0;If you want to close at 2.30 pm then please mention it. I called and you guys said you're open until 3pm. When we got there (40 minutes drive)They refused to serve us despite me protesting and explaining we drove a long way just to have lunch at his place. Nevertheless, he shrugged us off.Super disappointed.;juil-18;Il Etait Un Square
1;Best burger to date;5.0;Unreal burger and cannot explain how good they are. The cream cheese which is covered in the burger is to die for and the meat is such high quality. It really is the best burger I've had ever and if you're a burger fan, then this is the place for you.;juil-18;Il Etait Un Square
1;Delicious Gourmet Burgers;5.0;Service was excellent, and very polite. The burgers were delicious and my gf had the veggie option which was also lovely. Highly recommend!;juil-18;Il Etait Un Square
1;Good veggie option;5.0;As a vegetarian I'm used to getting pretty average food at regular restaurants, but that wasn't the case here, the falafel burger was great, staff were lovely, and they even gave us an English menu when they found out where we were from. Would definitely recommend;juil-18;Il Etait Un Square
1;Superb food and service!;5.0;We are a family of four and enjoyed the best burgers we have ever had here. The children had steak haché. Wonderful desert too.;juil-18;Il Etait Un Square
1;Good burgers;4.0;A very nice burger and tartar restaurant. The service is very good and their creme cheese recipe excellent.  Highly recommended.;juil-18;Il Etait Un Square
1;YUMMMY burgers;5.0;Great hearty burgers cooked PERFECTLY and delish pommes frites. They have plenty of variety on the menu but I keep returning for those burgers. If you have any room after the hunky burgers, their desserts are lovely. I recommend this gastro pub/bistro for a good lunch as well as a casual dinner with friends and/or famille...;juil-18;Il Etait Un Square
1;Great food excellent service;5.0;Cheeseburger was really good.  The service was great and the owner is very friendly and welcoming!  Will be back again.;juil-18;Il Etait Un Square
1;Great food, attentive service;5.0;My family of four had a variety of dinners - chicken skewers, burgers and a salad. All were delicious -but the desserts were heavenly! Warm apple crumble and coffee were not to be missed! Great meal - reasonably priced and service was very good.;juil-18;Il Etait Un Square
1;An absolute hidden gem! 💎 Best burger ever!;5.0;I found out about this restaurant through incredible TripAdvisor reviews and it absolutely did not disappoint! They make you feel so welcome as soon as you step in the door with great service and chat. The burgers in this place are AMAZING! So delicious, as was the dessert! A must go if you’re in Paris looking for incredible food at a reasonable price!;juil-18;Il Etait Un Square
1;Super friendly staff and excellent food;5.0;Had the montagnard burger, deliciously covered in cheese en perfectly seasoned. Highly recommend the café gourmand for dessert!Staff was very friendly and helpful.;juil-18;Il Etait Un Square
1;Must go if in Paris!;5.0;Our daughter found on the Michelin revue website. Our first visit, we had the Tuna TatTar and the Best burgers ever. Our next visit we had burgers again and the steak TarTar. Absolutely amazing. I wanted to hug the owner. Must visit. Small cafe atmosphere in a fun area.;juil-18;Il Etait Un Square
1;Perfection;5.0;One of the few foods I regularly eat are hamburgers, so coming from somebody who’s had an obscene amount of both food and bad burgers I am happy to say that this is by far the best hamburger I’ve ever had in my life. The meat was just utter perfection, ground beef can usually just feel like a bunch of shredded up cow entrails but it was as if they minced a finely marbled fillet and slapped it on an obscenely high quality bun. I was skeptical of the idea of beef tartar before this, but with meat this good, I can understand the appeal. Service was friendlier than I deserve and proportions were exactly the right size. If you are in Paris for any amount of time and are looking for some tasty meat, you owe it to yourself to make a pilgrimage to this establishment.;juin-18;Il Etait Un Square
1;Absolutely Amazing!;5.0;Food was unbelievable and beat all expectations from what reviews were given. The service was incredible and made you feel right at home. I would definitely go back and would recommend this place to anyone. Best food I've had in Paris easily.;juil-18;Il Etait Un Square
1;Excelent service and meal;5.0;Perfect burger and even better service willing to help to chose the menu and solve any issue. Will come back for sure.;juil-18;Il Etait Un Square
1;Great place, will come again!;5.0;I was in Paris for conference ans went to dinner with my collegueas. We made reservations but the restaurant didn't get it, and still they found seats for us. The owner greeted us in on our own laguages, and gave us free shots. Burgers were delicious, probably best I've ever had. I recommend this place to anyone who comes in Paris.;juil-18;Il Etait Un Square
1;The hype is true;5.0;One of the best burgers I’ve ever had. The patty was substantial enough but not too big to be overly messy or fall apart on you. The cheese and the toppings are really what makes these burgers great. I’ve never had anything like it before.;juin-18;Il Etait Un Square
1;Burgers of love;5.0;The reviews are very accurate - great, gracious owner with a friendly welcome- great burgers. We had five different ones. I enjoyed the French hamburger. Others in our group had the Cajun, Cheddar, and blue cheese. 30min walk from Nôtre Dame. Worth it;juin-18;Il Etait Un Square
1;Perfection;5.0;Simply the best burger I've eaten my whole life. The staff was very helpful and friendly. Would absolutely recommend this place.;juin-18;Il Etait Un Square
1;ABSOLUTELY AMAZING!;5.0;We chose this restaurant on Trip Advisor recommendation and were delighted with our choice. The owner greeted us enthusiastically and offered us a choice of seating indoors or outside. as there were only one other set of diners I suggested eating indoors and venturing outside afterwards for a coffee but he suggested it would be impossible. How right he was, the restaurant quickly filled up outside (where we chose) and the tables were filled with an interesting mix of diners. The menu although small was full of good choices and the greek salad and subsequent hamburger were delicious. When bringing the dessert the owner made sure one of his staff put a candle on top for my birthday which was an endearing touch. 10/10 all round!;juin-18;Il Etait Un Square
1;Couldn't be better!;5.0;Had a table booked for 7:30 and first walked past about 6:45 as the owner(?) was just opening up and setting out the outside tables. He caught us looking at the menus in the window and immediately came over to welcome us (not yet knowing we had a booking) and explained the menus to us. We then went over the road to a small cafe for a couple of beers before returning for our booking. The owner greeted us again and offered a range of tables we could sit at and went through the menus again in great detail for us.The burgers were delicious as was the dessert and as the booking had mentioned it was for a special birthday, the dessert came out with birthday candles!Great service, great food and great attention to detail. 5 stars all round;juin-18;Il Etait Un Square
1;Great service and personal and good food;4.0;We had great experience there. The burgers were good and the tiramisu was my favorite. Great wine too. Worth the trip. And the guy who owns the place was very welcoming. Loved it. And I recommend you to go there. 4 instead of 5 because I’ve had better burgers outside France .) so it’s based on my experiences.;juin-18;Il Etait Un Square
1;Excellent burgers and steak with great customer service;5.0;The food is amazing. The owner walked us through the menu and was very friendly but also gave us space to eat our food.The waitress was attentive and generally niceThe food is reasonably priced for a mid range meal and it was definitely worth the moneyGood cozy atmosphereThe homemade apple crumble was the best apple crumble I’ve ever had!;juin-18;Il Etait Un Square
1;Great burger and service;5.0;The MAX, and Cheddar burgers were really good. Service is outstanding as well. Will come back on our next visit in paris!;juin-18;Il Etait Un Square
1;Best Burger in Many Years;5.0;We read the amazing reviews and decided to try the burgers out. The beef, sourced from Central France, was beyond delicious and full of flavor. On top of the awesome burgers, the staff was nothing short of incredible - a very welcome change after dining around Paris for the past week. Thank you for the food and great experience!;juin-18;Il Etait Un Square
1;Always Fabulous;5.0;Belated review from May. Gerard the owner is very caring and actually wants you to experience the real Paris and great French food.We got to the romantic city twice a year and always makeIl Etait Un Square one of our main reasons to visit.;mai-18;Il Etait Un Square

1;Perfect Food;5.0;I enjoyed dinner here tonight. 100% deserve the trip adviser rating. I have drinks and 4 courses. 46 Euro. This is the best and cheapest place I have ever eaten and n Paris. Take your children as you will be welcome. I’m bringing my boy here. He will lnot Be it. Well done team. Excellent.;juin-18;Il Etait Un Square
1;Best Burger in all of France;5.0;"My wife and I made reservations for 9 PM and ended up arriving about a half hour early and we were able to be sat immediately. As soon as we were sat the owner explained the menu to us and how they differed from other burgers. I ordered The Max and my wife The Blue. Both burgers were by far the best we had anywhere in Europe. The cheese and toppings were all put together perfectly. I was especially pleased with the bun. On most burgers that are juicy and ""messy"" the buns just fall apart and it makes for a less than ideal experience. Not at Il Etait Un Square! There buns held up through the entire meal and made our experience so much better. The food came out fast and all waitstaff was eager to help with whatever request we had. We will absolutely visit again next time we are in Paris. Highly recommend.";juin-18;Il Etait Un Square
1;Il Etait Un Square;5.0;After seeing this restaurant review on TripAdvisor, we decided to give it a try. Two girls ordered burgers, one chicken sandwich (special of the week) and I ordered a Ribeye. We were greeted by the owner at the door. He apologized to us since the inside of his restaurant was all booked up for the evening. This was fine, we wanted to eat outside, we were in Paris! The wait staff was attentive and came to check on us regularly. The owner stopped by to make certain everything was cooked to our liking. Very personable!The burgers were delicious and my steak was much improved over the slab of “meat” I had eaten two days prior at a different location. The chicken sandwich disappeared so fast that I don’t know if she was really able to taste it! (Haha!). Frites were fantastic and served in cute little micro deep fryers. Overall experience was very positive and would recommend!;juin-18;Il Etait Un Square
1;Amazing burgers;5.0;My husband and u were in town for French open. We drove half hour across paris to go here for the amazing reviews. We weren't disappointed. It is a very casual place and basic so not fancy at all so jeans or shorts perfect. They specialise in burgers and hache and not a lot else. They do have one chicken burger option and a veggie burger option too. Wine list is small and limited but boy do the burgers make up for it. The meat is steak mince straight from the farm not the normal mince couple with the most amazing cheese toppings. My husband had the cheddar and I had the French burger which was with egg and cheddar. We both agreed it was the most amazing burger we have had in a long time. Staff were efficient and friendly. We would definitely go back.;juin-18;Il Etait Un Square
1;Story about Napoleon;5.0;Everythig was great. We ordered burgers and the meal was delicious. In addition to that the owner is a such nice person who is fascinated by Napoleon, so we had a conversation. We definitely recommend this place!;juin-18;Il Etait Un Square
1;Burgers off the beaten path;5.0;Family went after long day of exploring. My son was in the mood for a good burger. Based on the reviews we all had burgers and they didn’t disappoint. We had the French Burger, Max Burger and Bleu Burger and we all cleared our plates. Delicious. For Dessert based on reviews we couldn’t go without trying the tiramisu. I’m not a big tiramisu fan but it was worth the hype! We also ordered the chocolate fondant (great for chocolate lovers) and the apple fondant. All were delicious. Place is smaller so call for reservation. Owner was wonderful! We would definitely go back.;juin-18;Il Etait Un Square
1;Good;3.0;After reading all the comments of this place we thought we would give it a chance. My husband loves burgers and we try to always try one in every country/city we visit. So we went all the way to the restaurant, we ordered and the food arrived surprisingly fast, after like five minutes? We ordered medium but it was well done, not even a sign of pink inside, so my husband told them. The girl working said that that’s how medium looks there? but they will do a new one, rare this time. So he gets the burger and this time it’s rare but we didn’t care anymore. So it seems like they have rare or medium which was disappointing since we like our burgers to be medium! Anyway the burger was okay, I have tasted betters which was disappointing since we went all the way there. The tiramisu however was one of the best I ever had.;juin-18;Il Etait Un Square
1;Sensational;5.0;The burgers were amazing! Service was also incredible, with a great description of the menu and local ingredients sourced. This place is a must! The French cheese also makes it count as eating a 'French dish' .-);mai-18;Il Etait Un Square

1;Wonderful evening;5.0;Met up with friends and family, the evening was faultless. The staff seemed genuinely pleased to have us there. From the really warm welcome to the superb food, I can only give praise. They even encouraged us to move inside, minutes before the skies opened.;mai-18;Il Etait Un Square
1;Fantastic burgers, steak tartare, desserts, and service!;5.0;We read the gushing reviews of this place and had to try it during our visit to Paris. It was everything we hoped for, as the burgers and tartare and desserts were delectable, but what really stood out was the warmth of the excellent staff, who made us feel welcome immediately and were genuinely pleased that we enjoyed our meal. We can understand why the reviews are so outstanding, and would definitely say this is a must-visit for any Paris trip!;mai-18;Il Etait Un Square

1;A Paris restaurant MUST;5.0;My husband and I spent the day sightseeing and ended our evening with a fabulous dinner at Il Etait Un Square. We were greeted immediately at seated. Our menu was thoroughly explained to us in English, as we are American. We ordered a Ribeye(cooked medium as I ordered and perfectly). It came with a salad and fries. We also ordered a burger with Roquefort cheese. It came with a salad and fries as well. We ordered the Camembert cheese plate. All was absolutely wonderful and our service was superior!;mai-18;Il Etait Un Square

We had the burger and steak for the main course which were delicious. Along with the dinner had a nice bottle of wine. Had three deserts all of them were great;mai-18;Il Etait Un Square
1;End a nice neighborhood walk with a mouth-watering blue cheese burger;5.0;Walked a little bit from the metro to get to this place. Dont be fooled by the quaint restaurant and the cozy community. Their burgers here were absolutely fantastic. The meat was well cooked, but the blue cheese sauce was divine. It was absolutely worth the trip to Paris to come and eat here. And the people were all very friendly, made our Paris dining experience a delight. I would never have thought that I would recommend a burger joint to eat at in Paris but this has to be done!;avr-18;Il Etait Un Square
1;Go all the way to Paris for a burger? YES!;5.0;Everything about this place is good. The waitstaff is friendly, and several speak English. There were some unusual burgers on the menu, which made it hard to choose, but I finally decided on the blue cheese burger. It was fantastic. This was such an enjoyable experience we talked about going back but decided to stick to our rule of trying different places. So I think I have to go back to Paris to eat here again.;avr-18;Il Etait Un Square

Totally recommend this spot!;mai-18;Il Etait Un Square
1;Fabulous Burgers and Tartare;5.0;We are here on Friday 11th May after booking a table (recommended). The Burgers were really tasty coming covered in delicious cheddar cream cheese sauce.

1;Good tasty burger;4.0;I planned to visit this restaurant while in Paris after reading about it on trip advisor. Burger is #1 food for my nephew, so after a long walk we ordered 2 burgers...they were tasty, great meat and the owner and staff were so friendly;avr-18;Il Etait Un Square
1;Try the burger!;5.0;I spend a week eating in this beautiful city! If you want something easy but of very good quality try the burger that they done, the meat is delicious!;mars-18;Il Etait Un Square
1;Perfect Little Gem in Paris;5.0;We went to the restaurant based on TA overwhelming good review. Well...that was deserved! Though the place is a little bit out of Paris main tracks, it’s perfectly located near the subway station making it a small walk from Corvisart station. Menu is not extensive, what is always a good sign in Paris, and mainly focus on Burgers & Tartares (raw meat) so both offer vegetarian options! Very good quality meat and plate, and don’t miss the homemade ketchup either ! Best burger I had in Paris so far, and some burgers have a “Parisian twist” that is only an homage to the US style burger. Go there if you’re in Paris! Cheddar burger is recommended but I didn’t have a chance to try another :);avr-18;Il Etait Un Square
1;What am I missing?;2.0;I am not sure this is even the best burger on their block, much less Paris. We went here for lunch today and I had the traditional tartare and my husband had the cheddar burger. The food came out so fast after we ordered, the patty was obviously pre-cooked and then heated for our order. It was way over cooked (well done when we ordered medium). The bun just kind of crumbles, not a good choice for a burger bun. The fries are about the same as McDonalds. All in all, disappointing. I would not recommend going out of ones way to eat here while in Paris.;avr-18;Il Etait Un Square
1;Great restaurant;5.0;Went there with a family of five, 3 adults, 2 kids under 10. Fantastic service. The owner personally took the time to explain the different options on the menu.

1;5 Stars!;5.0;My partner and I thoroughly enjoyed our meal here. I am a vegetarian and, although there were only a few choices, my burger was great. My girlfriend eats meat and said that her burger was possibly the best she'd ever had. The service was fantastic. The person that served us was very enthusiastic and passionate about the menu and where the ingredients were sourced locally. He explained the various dishes and how they were made. Our waitress was really friendly and attentive.;avr-18;Il Etait Un Square

1;Very veggie freindly;5.0;The meny quite small but the food was of great quality. I would highly recomend this resturant for vegitarians, despite there only being two veggie options as a main course, the food was good enough that it was worth it.;avr-18;Il Etait Un Square

1;French Burger-heaven;5.0;Seriously?? Who would ever think that we would have the BEST burger ever in France! We ended up visiting this place on a whim and it was amazing!! Great burgers, drinks and dessert! They basically have burgers and steaks with a French flair. Outstanding service. Our 6 and 9 year old have already asked if we can come back here tomorrow. I know this does not sound like classic French food but this place was honestly extremely good;mars-18;Il Etait Un Square
1;One of the best burgers I've ever had;5.0;We visited based on the recommendations on here, and it didn't disappoint. In a busy lunch hour they were able to squeeze us in and spend time talking us through the amazing menu. Really friendly staff who really cared about us enjoying our meal and the experience. I had the Cheddar burger and my boyfriend had the chicken burger - both excellent and washed down with 2 large beers. A great place to stop if you've just visited the Catacombs.

Being from the US, I have enjoyed a great many. The staff was very kind and happy to find a seat for me even though I did not have a reservation. And the whole staff was very generous in accommodating me in excellent English as I was very clumsy in my attempts to speak very bad French. Would come here again for sure. In fact I plan to come again before I leave Paris!;mars-18;Il Etait Un Square

They recommended a very nice bottle of wine from Bordeaux. The food was hot and delicious and the flavors were adventurous. Our daughter had the duck confit that actually reminded us of a Thanksgiving turkey leg that everyone fights over. The meat on the burgers was fresh and had a great flavor. If you like burgers, give this place a try. The staff really made this experience a great one.;mars-18;Il Etait Un Square

1;Best burger;5.0;Great burger and friendly staff. The cheddar burger and tiramisu was incredible. Recommend making a reservation. Will be coming back!;févr-18;Il Etait Un Square
1;One of the best burgers we've ever had!!!;5.0;Wow this place was amazing! We had no idea what to expect and inside is a lovely homely restaurant with beautiful homemade food! I had the cheddar and my boyfriend had the French beefburger and both were incredible! Waiting staff were amazing and what a lovely touch to offer English menus to help us feel at home! Highly highly recommend this place and certainly will be going back the next time we're in Paris!;févr-18;Il Etait Un Square
1;"""Good burgers do not require a lot of fuss...""";5.0;Excellent service and very friendly owner. They made our day even before serving us two amazing burgers. Good burgers do not need a lot of fuss...Just a lot of smiles and good quality products !!!!!!!!;févr-18;Il Etait Un Square
1;Had better for a lot less;3.0;The good things first... The service was great... Welcoming and very helpful... The restaurant is very nice... And the chips were very good... Now the bad things... the burger at 16 euros I'm sorry but there's plenty of places in the UK that do a better burger than that for half the price... And as with all the Paris restaurants I've eaten at (been here 4 nights) unless u have the house wine the drink prices are a joke... 7.5 euros for a large beer!!!;févr-18;Il Etait Un Square
1;Amazing burgers. Great staff and experience;5.0;Amazing food! First time in Paris and I trusted Yelp for many places to go. This place is a for sure! Amazing burgers. I got the max and my Husband got the Cheddar. Great friends. Amazing desserts. Excellent service. Can't go wrong.;févr-18;Il Etait Un Square
1;Great burgers with really friendly staff!!;4.0;We were impressed with this restaurant and with the staff! They were really friendly and the host (hats off to him) because he does everything to satisfy the customers. This is the first time I saw this in a French restaurant!We had the classic burgers and the burgers were really good.;févr-18;Il Etait Un Square
1;Perrrrrrrrrrrrrrrfectt;5.0;Yes I know, the “burger again?really?” feeling will pop up in your mind when you see this restaurant reviews and photos, plus the distance when you click the map. I have a motion sickness caused by rude paris taxi driver that seems didn’t know how to drive properly, and the traffic got me 1 hour to get there from gare du nord. If it wasnt because of my insisted-wife i might never made it to this high-class burger spa, where every burger treated with love so they can come up in front of you real fresh, beautiful, and tasted sooo perfectBelieve me the burgers and the owners will make you forget that you are in Paris, a (fake) love city.;févr-18;Il Etait Un Square
1;Hidden Gem!;5.0;After a 45 minute drive in rush hour traffic I must admit it being a bit disappointed by what looked like a pretty ordinary Parisian neighbourhood cafe but that was the only time I was disappointed all evening. Right from the welcoming staff, through the ‘American style’ menu talk through to the excellent burgers, we had a great evening. As one reviewer said, “This is a burger (and tartare) joint” so don’t expect much else on the menu. If you appreciate a good burger, this is well worth the trip.;févr-18;Il Etait Un Square
1;très bien;5.0;Delicious! The staff is fun, helpful and attentive. Burgers were perfect and the tiramisu was so good we almost ordered more.;févr-18;Il Etait Un Square
1;Great experience;5.0;As a burger addict I can clearly say that I really enjoyed the friendly staff and yummy burgers, glad to visited the place :);janv-18;Il Etait Un Square
1;Best burger in Paris!!!;5.0;Went there for dinner and had to come back the next day for lunch. The wife loved it even more! A must stop in Paris! Owners and the rest of the personnel were very attentive and nice.;janv-18;Il Etait Un Square
1;Wrong Order Still 5 Stars;5.0;Unfortunately received a very similar, but different, table’s order and only realised half way through meal. Restaurant offered to replace very genuinely on multiple occasions and gave us complimentary wine and dessert. Couldn’t have been nicer about it. Incidentally the Panna Cotta was so good we both ordered a second one.;janv-18;Il Etait Un Square
1;Basic Burger Joint;3.0;We thought this was going to be a Gourmet burger type of place (a la 'Elephant & Castle' of NYC & Dublin or 'Corner Bistro' NYC) and spent the price of a meal on the taxi, oops! In reality it's a pretty basic burger joint. The 'Cheddar Burger' is smothered with American Cheese (not quality Cheddar). The place is very casual and looks a little grubby (restaurant and rest rooms). That said, the staff were very friendly and helpful when my 'medium-well' burger was served 'medium-rare' they re-made it with a smile, very quickly too. Perfectly adequate if you want a quick bite of quality-meat burger for approx. €16 each with normal fries and small amount of salad/garnish.;janv-18;Il Etait Un Square
1;Great Burgers!!!;5.0;We went there for lunch. The place did not disappoint. The staff was wonderful and the burgers were great!!;janv-18;Il Etait Un Square
1;amazing burgers and tartar;5.0;as soon as we entered I loved the familiarity of the place, even for tourists. the burger was clearly in top 3 burgers I’ve ever eaten.;janv-18;Il Etait Un Square
1;Best burger I have ever had!!;5.0;My mom and I visited Paris last week and I am SO GLAD we came here. The cheddar burger is the best burger I have ever had and the service was probably the best we had in Paris - and the service was good almost everywhere we went!! i highly recommend this place it is an absolute gem!;janv-18;Il Etait Un Square
1;Nice!;4.0;Very friendly and attentive staff, menu focuses on hamburgers and “tatare”, good quality meat, recommendable!;janv-18;Il Etait Un Square
1;Excellent dining experience;5.0;Nice casual place with welcoming staff. Dinner was amazing. Recommend the tartar steak with foie gras, a real treat. Would return and recommend.;janv-18;Il Etait Un Square
1;Great burgers;5.0;We visited the restaurant on a Friday night without reservation and we were lucky to find a table.The staff was welcoming since the very first moment and they remained very attentive all over the evening. The food was exquisite, ingredients were fresh and tasty with the cuisine exalting the flavors. We had a “Montagnard” and a “Le bleu” burgers and were both delicious. We also ordered some red wine in the caraffe and it was a nice surprise as the quality was encomiabile.All considered it’s a quality place that we’d surely recommend.A suggestion would be to study a way to make French fries as awesome as the burgers. now are simply good.;janv-18;Il Etait Un Square
1;Good Burgers and Good Service;5.0;Friendly restaurant specialising in Burger and Tartare. We all went for burgers and all enjoyed them. Would definitely recommend and will be back;janv-18;Il Etait Un Square
1;Yummy burger and super friendly service;5.0;Burger was delicious exactly as described by all previous reviews. In addition, all waiters are super friendly and do effort to earn the high rating. Highly recommended and definitely will go again;déc-17;Il Etait Un Square
1;Had a great meal at I’m était;4.0;We were craving a burger and saw the reviews for this spot. Upon entering we were greeted very warmly and seated at our table. Wonderful description of the menu followed. We had the foie gras appetizer which apparently is made in house. It was fantastic. We all fulfilled the need for a high quality burger. I read some reviews about it being too messy but that was Not the case. Fries were spot on and the salad gave a nice complement to the meal. They even gave us a digestive. Great place and will definitely be back on my next trip to Paris.;déc-17;Il Etait Un Square
1;Best Burger Ever;5.0;We absolutely LOVED this restaurant! It’s a bit out of the way from everything else that’s going on in Paris but it was SO worth the little trek. Reading the reviews before, it sounded like it gets pretty crowded but did not make a reservation so we decided to get there right after they opened at 7:30pm and were seated with no difficulty. However, when we left around 9:00-9:15pm it was pretty crowded so you may want to make a reservation just in case. First off, the staff are very welcoming and sweet. We were greeted with a smile and they made sure we got an English menu. Then another waiter came and explained the menu to us while telling us a little about the restaurant’s background and everything. Every month, they feature a special burger as their “burger of the month”. This month it was The Burger Le Savoyard. It was a burger but instead of on a bun, it was between two crispy potato patties with crunchy salad, chives, and ham slices topped with a creamy cheese sauce. IT WAS AMAZING and by far the best burger I have ever had. I am going to be dreaming about it forever. My husband got The Cheddar burger and he too said that is was the best burger he had ever had. They also have wine, beer, and other alcoholic drinks for selection, all at very fair prices. We did not get dessert, although I would have loved to, but we were just so full! We saw some desserts for another table and they looked so yummy! Since we didn’t get dessert our waitress gave us a gift of 2 limoncello shots to end our dining experience, which I thought was super sweet. Overall this was our favorite meal we had in Paris. The next time we are back in Paris, we will go back to this restaurant, there is no question.;déc-17;Il Etait Un Square
1;Absolutely Fantastic;5.0;We booked in advance via the Fork after seeing the reviews on here and I am so glad we did. The restaurant quickly filled up and despite this, we were served very quickly and provided with a great level of service. The owner was very welcoming and took time to greet guests. All staff were very helpful and friendly. The burgers were incredible. Easily the best burger we have ever eaten, the cream of cheese sauce that they use is so delicious. The burgers melt in your mouth. Great portion sizes, worth every penny. Dessert was also very good, cannot fault this restaurant. Well done! Will definitely visit on our next stay in Paris. Thanks again.;déc-17;Il Etait Un Square
1;Super burgers, nice service;5.0;Although the location is somewhat remote and quiet (Metro stop Corvisart on line 6), this place is obviously becoming more popular, esnecially amoungst a younger clientele. We arrived at 20:00, but by then more than half of the tables were occupied and there was a lively atmosphere.As I had the excellent Tartare Gascon last time (April 2017) I now wanted to try out one of the burgers and chose Le Bleu. Very good, juicy beef, but the bacon croustillant was somewhat unrecognizable (so little of it). Good fries. My wife very much enjoyed her Le Montagnard with caramelized onions and a good portion of dried bresaola chunks.All this with a nice carafe of red wine, and we were ready for our long walk to Rue Mouffetard for a street crepe dessert.;déc-17;Il Etait Un Square
1;Great Burgers;5.0;Great staff, very helpful and cheerful, they explained the menu and provided recommendations were. I went for the Cheddar burger - it was excellent - an extremely satisfying meal. Highly recommended, will visit again!;nov-17;Il Etait Un Square

1;Amazing food, super friendly people;5.0;We turned up at the end of the evening, the staff very kindly found us a table even though they were super busy. So accommodating and friendly. Food was absolutely fantastic, one of the best burgers I've ever had! Definitely would come back and highly recommended.;nov-17;Il Etait Un Square
1;Best burger ever and service with a smile;5.0;We went there for a burger last night and we all loved it. We hadn't reserved but the host was super accommodating and the burgers were delicious. we also had desserts which didnt disappoint. Very reasonable priced, especially considering the quality of food.;nov-17;Il Etait Un Square
1;Exceptional Food and Service;5.0;Myself and my husband ate here on friday 10th and saturday 11th November (it was so good on the first night we booked again). We got a lovely welcome from the owner Gerard and Emily and Maxine the waitresses. Gerard went on to explain the menu to us - they specialise in Burgers and Tartare dishes. We choose the famous Cheese Burgers with fantastic crispy french fries and salad. I wanted mine 'Bien Cuit' well done and Emily took great care that my burger arrived exactly the way i wanted it. Oh those burgers were Amazing - the meat was succulent from Charollais Cows - Yummy. I had the Tiramisu served in a glass - it was excellent. Drinks wise the White wine was Bourgogne and a carafe cost €7 - I loved it and my husband had a pint of beer and we had a bottle of vittel water. The Bill was under €60 - an Exceptional price for an Exceptional Meal. The second night I had the Cheese Burger again and my husband had the Rib Eye Steak which he said was a great piece of meat. Again we had wine and water and Tiramisu and still the bill was under €60. What a great find in Paris - 'Il Etait Un Square' is an Exceptional place for Food and Service. Thank you so much to all the Staff for looking after us so well - We will return. All the best Jean & Pius Monahan, Ireland;nov-17;Il Etait Un Square
1;Delicious good & great servuce;5.0;We visited Il Etait Un Square this evening for dinner and it absolutely lived up to the great reviews we had read on Trip Advisor.We were greeted by a super friendly team, asking us where we were from and inviting us warmly into their restaurant. We sat down at our table and were told all about the menu and style of the restaurant, they specialise in Burgers and Tartare. We went for the burgers along with a carafe of rose and a beer. The drinks and food arrived quickly and were just as quickly demolished! They were delicious and it was great to be asked the degree of cooking before the meal was made.We then ordered coffee and a shared dessert which we really enjoyed. To top it off when we asked for the bill be were given complimentary lemoncello.The overall experience was great! Service and food were perfect! We look forward to visiting again when we return to Paris one day :)Warmest regards, The New Zealanders :);nov-17;Il Etait Un Square
1;Friendly staff and great burgers;5.0;Great option if you're staying in Paris and you're unsure of where to eat. Staff spoke great english and the food was quality. Highly recommended.- New Zealanders;nov-17;Il Etait Un Square
1;Fantastic burgers and service;5.0;Found this place on-line. It's a bit off the beaten (tourist) path, but man are the burgers fantastic. The owner is also incredibly nice and offered a free amaretto or limencello after our meal. When it started pouring rain outside (where we were eating), we ran inside to wait it out and have another glass of wine. He gave us the wine free of charge as well, apologizing for the rain as if it were his fault. Highly recommended if you're in the mood for burgers or tartar.;sept-17;Il Etait Un Square
1;Amazing burgers;5.0;This place is amazing! We booked through trip advisor which was helpful! Absolutely delicious burgers! Staff so friendly and ask how you would like your burger cooked! I ordered well done as I hate any pinkness ! They cooked it perfectly and even offered to cook it more of it wasn’t well done enough! Menus available in English was helpful as we knew about 2 words in French! Staff also gave us a complimentary shot after our meal which was lovely!! Definitely 5 stars!!!;nov-17;Il Etait Un Square
1;Food with real quality;5.0;So I just discovered this place thanks to other TA travelers and contributors. I had a burger which is not something I have as a habit since most burger joints do not use good quality meet. These filks do. The owner has a real partnerships with caring farmers and great supplies.If you happen not to like great meet based like Stake Tartar or burgers, they have wonderful veggi options.I recommended it;nov-17;Il Etait Un Square
1;Good burgers;5.0;Excellent burgers and amazing french friest. The meat was prepared very well. Everything was perfect.;sept-17;Il Etait Un Square

1;Mouth watering burgers!;5.0;We are a group travelling from New Zealand who sort out Il Etait Un Square through trip advisor. 5 stars is not enough to warrant how delicious these burgers are!

1;Extraordinary;5.0;Perfect! Really impressed with the quality and taste of the Burger!!! The sides are perfect, both salad and fries and the Burger is actually made of meat!! Really like the spice and the mustard is great! Do recommend!;oct-17;Il Etait Un Square
1;An extraordinary burger.;5.0;We arrived at the restaurant at 19.00 and were the first ones in. About 10 minutes later the place was crowded, which speaks for itself. Besides us there were not a lot of tourists but many parisiens. The owner is a really nice and funny guy, who enjoys a good laugh with the waiters. That gave the restaurant a relaxed atmosphere. We ordered a A salad and a Tartare as starters and the cheddar burger as our main dish. The service was fast. If you are looking for a really good burger, this is the place for you.;oct-17;Il Etait Un Square
1;Amazing burgers;5.0;Excellent, 'melt in your mouth' burgers and great service!! Great value also. Would definitely recommend.;oct-17;Il Etait Un Square
1;Delish!;5.0;The service was excellent and the food was amazing. I loved the cheddar burger and the French fries were so good I will definitely return when I go back to Paris. The place is not near much, but the walk was worth it.;oct-17;Il Etait Un Square
1;Yes, a burger/tartar place worthy of the metro ride;5.0;Yes, I went to a burger joint in Paris, and had to travel a distance there to the 13th Arrondissement, likely known to visitors mostly because of this little restaurant. It’s a great experience with a difference, the menu very simply structured, but creative and versatileTwo kinds of dishes of any note are offered, the burgers and the tartars, served in a space richly adorned with pictures of bovines involved, beautiful, unblemished red heifers worthy of Biblical utility. Burgers are cooked to order, presented with various toppings, but invariably with melted, not sliced, cheese. Mine was topped with tomato, Reblochon and ample serving of shaved bresaola. Cooked to the specified medium-rare, it was a real marvel of meaningfully inventive cookingIs it worth the trip? I think it is, especially in at least a slightly bigger party, allowing to explore the tartar side of the menu through sharing. There are at least half dozen of variations, most looking rather enticing;oct-17;Il Etait Un Square
1;Great food and service;5.0;Nothing pretentious, just great food. We both had the burgers my only complaint is I didn't have time to go back and try again;oct-17;Il Etait Un Square
1;Amazing hidden jewel;5.0;"We stumbled upon this place on trip advisor and decided to check it out. We are from the US and was skeptical about a good ""burger"" in Paris. They serve two main things here: Variations of Burgers and Tartare (and other apps, salads, + deserts). OMG! I travel a lot and I know that the mystique of a different city can cause you to overrate things. however, this is the best burger I've tasted. The wife loved it too and she is not a big red meat eater. The homemade tiramisu was bomb too. SUPER friendly staff too!";oct-17;Il Etait Un Square
1;Amazing Burgers;5.0;The burgers here were beautifully made. The golden buns holding the luscious meat covered in a saucy cheddar cheese. Don’t forget the perfectly crispy bacon that was nestled inside.;oct-17;Il Etait Un Square
1;Fantastic Burger;5.0;We had a fantastic burger, great meat cooked just right with some very interesting and enhancing toppings. The restaurant wonderful hosts added to the lovely evening and completed the best dinner we had in Paris.;oct-17;Il Etait Un Square
1;Great burger in Paris;5.0;Just had dinner there tonight and the service was quick, food was great and the owner was very nice. They welcome Americans. I ordered the cheddar burger.;oct-17;Il Etait Un Square
1;Amazing;5.0;The best burger in Paris ✨Cheddar burger shall not be missed.. For sure, I will return to this restaurant in my next visit to Paris;oct-17;Il Etait Un Square
1;Fantstic service, great food - must visit when in the area!;5.0;A bit late to write this but worth a mention! This was the first place we ate at in Paris and it was excellent. The owner or manager greeted us and realised from my pidgin French that we were English! He then gave us menus written in English and talked us through the menu, the specials and how their burgers are made in particular. We had cheeses and salads to start which were delicious, then I had a special veal burger which tasted incredible! The food was very well priced and the quality was fantastic. I'd definitely come back to Il Etait Un Square - its a hidden gem.;mai-17;Il Etait Un Square
1;Brilliant burgers;5.0;Seriously great burgers. I usually feel s bit stuffed or like greasy after a burger but these just were really tasty and I didn't feel bad afterwards.;sept-17;Il Etait Un Square
1;Best burger and superb friendly servers!;5.0;Incredible homemade mayo/egg appetizer...sounds strange but you must try it! Owner and wait staff equally friendly and fluent in English and French. You can share a burger and fries and it's perfect. Complimentary appettif of amaretto or lemoncello. You must try!!!!;sept-17;Il Etait Un Square
1;Fabulous!!;5.0;It has been since the beginning of the year but I made it back to Paris and had to stop. Brought a coworker along since I was bragging about this place. The owner is tremendous and loves his place. The service is great. And the burgers are FABULOUS!!!! I had told myself I was going to do the tartare last time but I could not deviate from the burger. I had the burger of the month, The Ched Pepper. Tremendous. A cheddar sauce with pepper and caramelized onions. I cannot get enough of this place. Whenever I am in Paris this restaurant will be on my list.;sept-17;Il Etait Un Square
1;Amazing!;5.0;Decided to go here simply because we were close by. We didn't book a table,but this wasn't a problem,they got us a table straight away. They are really welcoming and friendly, speak very good English and took the time to go through the menu with us. We had the cheddar burger and blue burger with home made chips. They really were amazing, freshly made and just tasted great! We also had desert, which was beautiful too! Really good little restaurant, not over priced at all, a must!;sept-17;Il Etait Un Square
1;Good but not extraordinary;4.0;The largest part of the menu is burgers. The food was good, but not a five star food in my opinion. Interesting: they had artisanal ketchup.;sept-17;Il Etait Un Square
1;One the best burgers I’ve ever had!;5.0;It’s a small place near corvisart area. I went there without a reservation thinking I would get a table, only to learn that they were full and could not host me. But the staff was kind enough to somehow make some space for me and offer me a place ( I guess they figured that I am a tourist ). I had the Cajun burger and it has to be the best burger I have had in a looong time ! Im sure the orther dishes on the menu are awesome too!Loved the place and the food! Bonus for the welcoming staff! A must visit.Thanks guys !;sept-17;Il Etait Un Square
1;Good food and even better staff and service!;4.0;Went here with my mother last night solely based on the TripAdvisor rating as we were craving burgers. To be honest I was expecting this to be the best burger I've ever had since the rating and customer reviews were so incredibly high. The burger itself while being good, was not the best I've ever had and being from the Midwest I know a great burger when I have one. The bun they use is very light and fluffy, which I enjoyed as it didn't make you feel too full and weighed down. I had the Blue Cheese burger and my mother got the Cheddar Pepper, which is the burger of the month. We both liked hers better. The fries were very underwhelming however, as they were not crisp in the least. The best thing about this neighborhood restaurant was the warm and friendly staff and service! They took time to go over every aspect of the menu and sincerely made us feel welcome. They even called us a cab when it was time to leave. Overall I would recommend this restaurant for a fairly good burger experience, but even more so for the friendly staff and service.;sept-17;Il Etait Un Square
1;Must visit !;5.0;The vegetation & Cajun Chicken burgers are amazing. If you're after an amazing place to eat in Paris , you must visit!;sept-17;Il Etait Un Square
1;Best burgers ever;5.0;We visited the Square only base on the TripAdvisor's ranking and boy we are not regretting this! Not sure what they add in the meat but there is a special addictive flavor + the brilliant melting cheese!;août-17;Il Etait Un Square
1;Best hamburgers ever!;5.0;My husband and I I ate at this restaurant last night. Based on the reviews we were expecting a great meal and that is what we got! I had the burger of the month, cheddar and my husband had the blue cheese. The burgers are large and I didn't think I could eat the whole thing but we didn't leave a crumb on our plates. It was so juicy and flavourful. We both said they were the best burgers we have ever had.;sept-17;Il Etait Un Square
1;So delicious;5.0;My father and I had the most juicy and delicious burgers here tonight. They source the meat from a special cow and do a small menu but everything is top notch. We are non French speaking Americans and felt very comfortable and welcomed here. Highly recommend.;sept-17;Il Etait Un Square
1;Great food and service;5.0;I have to admit not only the best burger in Paris but probably the best burger I have ever tasted. It makes such a difference when the staff is so friendly and accommodating they made us feel so welcome and appreciated. Eating here was one of the highlights of our whole trip!!;sept-17;Il Etait Un Square
1;Best burger in Paris;5.0;This was the best food I have eaten in Paris! Absolutely amazing what this place can do for hamburger and fries. I would say the the staff were some of the nicest we had during our whole trip too. Owner is extremely nice and makes you want to come back again. You got it buddy. I'll be back;sept-17;Il Etait Un Square
1;What a burger!!!!!;5.0;Visited based on reviews and wasn't disappointed. It's location is out of the way but well worth it if you like burgers. I had the blue cheese and my gf had the Cajun chicken. Both were unbelievable. Service was great as well.;sept-17;Il Etait Un Square
1;Great;5.0;I saw this place on my last day and Paris and with it being so close to my hotel I figured why not? Even after being 15 minutes for my reservation I still was treated with great customer service. When I visited I tried the burger of the month, which was the cheddar burger with bacon and caramelized onions and it was fantastic better than places I've eaten while in France and the US;sept-17;Il Etait Un Square
1;Wowy;4.0;Nice place around the street corner. You can sit outside on the pavement or inside. We had their speciality burgers. The were just too good. The service is pretty fast and food is not priced too high. The staff are very friendly. They also serve alcoholic beverages.Lovely place.;août-17;Il Etait Un Square
1;Best Burger in Paris!!;5.0;Still dreaming of the cheddar burger..this is a must stop in Paris, the burger literally melts in you're mouth!! The owner and staff are also sooo friendly and accommodating. I can't wait until the next time!!!;août-17;Il Etait Un Square

1;Great burgers with fantastic service!;5.0;During our recent trip to Paris on one night we faced a familiar question: what to have for dinner? I started browsing TripAdvisor and came across Il était un square and the reviews were amazing. This absolutely peaked my interest and even though the restaurant was literally across the city we decided to try it. The neighbourhood is very residential which is nice and the restaurant is located on the side of a small square. We were one of the first people there and the owner greeted us. We didn't have a reservation but luckily that wasn't a problem. The burgers were just as good as I imagined. The service was amazing and the place had a really family-like feeling. Highly recommend this hidden gem!;juin-17;Il Etait Un Square
1;Burgers for dinner;5.0;Best burgers- if you like melted cheese dropping off your burger go ahead and order two!  The staff was awesome can't wait to go back.;juil-17;Il Etait Un Square
1;OMG SVP;5.0;An owner who knows his beef, sourcing finest world quality beef and cheeses. The staff are very helpful. Let me get to the menu. The chef's foi grois is amazing and a sprinkle of ground rock salt. The bread served was warm and fresh. The salad was very fresh. My wife had goat cheese salad and I had a bite - buttery, sweet and full of flavour - wow. We ordered steaks - again well cooked medium rare and my wife had the Angus and I had rib eye fillet - both with blue cheese sauce. Served with fresh salad and a tiny basket of fries. For desert we shared the chefs Tiramisu and again we were amazed at the simplicity but full of flavour. If you are in Paris, this restaurant has to be on your bucket list.;juil-17;Il Etait Un Square
1;Great place for dinner!;5.0;We decided to eat her on our last night in Paris and were glad to end it on such a high! amazing burgers, very friendly and welcoming staff in a very nice neighbourhood! Would highly recommend it you will not regret it.;juil-17;Il Etait Un Square
1;Best Burgers Ever!;5.0;My fiancé and I visited this restaurant while we were staying in Paris. We read the reviews on TripAdvisor before we left and really want to try it out. We were not disappointed. The food was absolutely delicious. The owners were very friendly and went through the menu with us. I had the Cajun Chicken Burger. It was very tasty. I cannot remember the name of my finance's burger, but it was very good as well. We also had the apple crumble for desert. The apples very very fresh and refreshing. I would definitely recommend eating here if you are ever in Paris.;juil-17;Il Etait Un Square
1;Excellent burger, incredibly friendly owner/manager, and great dessert;5.0;When do you make your last dinner in Paris a cheeseburger? When you see that the place is ranked #6 out of the 14,000 restaurants in Paris and located in a quiet neighborhood away from the bustle of the city.  Il était un square did not disappoint. The food was perfectly cooked (one of the best burgers I've had) and the service was efficient and friendly. If you need a burger or want to try some steak tartare while you're in Paris, this is the place to do it.And have the tiramisu. You won't regret it.;juil-17;Il Etait Un Square
1;Great In Every Way!;5.0;Just a 5 minute walk from Place d'Italie metro station on a QUIET corner, who would think a burger restaurant would be so good. A wonderful, English-speaking,friendly staff who goes above and beyond to explain the menus, available in English, and answer questions. The food was fantastic--all the positives from previous reviewers are true. A truly unique burger with crisp accompanying fries and salad. And the chocolate fondant was heaven! Well worth a little extra effort to travel to the hidden gem!;juil-17;Il Etait Un Square
1;Best cheeseburger we've ever had!;5.0;We found this spot on TripAdvisor and couldn't have been more satisfied. The burgers all use a creamed version of the cheese and we went with the cheddar. I can honestly say it was the best cheeseburger we've ever had. Meat was cooked to perfection (medium plus = medium well in France), the cheese sauce perfectly gooey and cheesy, and the bun was incredibly soft. Everything from the homemade fries, ketchup, and tiramisu were amazing as well. Our servers were both incredibly nice, which was a nice change from some of the other places we've visited.Highly recommend for anyone looking for a nice spin on a classic dish like the cheeseburger and fries.-Armenians From Los Angeles (thanks Jacque);juil-17;Il Etait Un Square
1;It's why we use Tripadvisor;5.0;This restaurant is excellent. It's full of locals and tourists and there's clearly a passion for good food, great service and Pinot Noir. It's a place you'd never have found before Tripadvisor and is worth going out of your way to visit. It's 2 mins from the metro station on a quiet street and the owner and staff are very friendly and, importantly for me, speak English.;juil-17;Il Etait Un Square
1;Really nice Burgers but more on the expensive side.;5.0;One can get really nice burgers with the meat cooked up to the demand. The service was friendly. It wasn't the cheapest place. But for 25 euros per person we could have a main dish, some shared French dessert and a bottle of red wine for 4 people. Good for a one time visit :) maybe not for regular eating for students like me.;juil-17;Il Etait Un Square
1;Great;5.0;Awesome !!!!!  Very nice foods and great atmosphere  The burger is fantastic all option of topping  Thank for the good;juil-17;Il Etait Un Square

1;Average at best.;3.0;Travelled out to the restaurant based on the reviews on trip advisor. Not in a touristy area which was nice and the restaurant felt comfortable and inviting. While the service was good and the manager was lovely the food was disappointing and couldn't recommend to go here for the food.;juil-17;Il Etait Un Square
1;The cheddar  burger is amazing;5.0;Truly the best burger i tried in Paris ! Definitely must visit place if you are in Paris. The only thing that i didn't like is the place, it is really far from centre :(;juil-17;Il Etait Un Square
1;Incredible burgers, different from cow Town USA;5.0;We weren't aware they preferred a reservation but they found room for us at 8pm, so still early. However it filled up quickly. I am from an area of the US known for beef, but have never had a flavor like this before. Meat was fresh from South France and the balsamic added this je ne sais quoi. Everyone spoke great English, and had a full English menu. Must go!;juil-17;Il Etait Un Square
1;Incredible!!!!;5.0;The best burger in my life, if you are in Paris and you love Burgers, is a MUST VISIT!! Staff is amaizing, just worthless!!;juil-17;Il Etait Un Square
1;Deliciouss burger!Go for it!!;5.0;We found this place through trip advisor! Must say although a little bit out of our way! Worth going! Its not in a touristy area but more of a neighborhood restaurant! It was packed!We ordered three burgers with fries! The host there super friendly and very helpful! The buns were delicious and the patties of the burger were sooooo tasty! Probably one of the best burgers i had! Their homemade tomatoe ketchup soo sweet ! Made in heaven! Worth going! Paid round 20 each! With 2 glasses of wine and a soft drink! Go go go!;juil-17;Il Etait Un Square
1;Hamburger place with a twist;5.0;Hamburger place where you can enjoy foie gras and tartare. Excellent meat with twist of haute cuisine! No wonder this is ranked #5 out of 17000+ restaurants in Paris;juil-17;Il Etait Un Square
1;Very nice restaurant;5.0;A very nice restaurant with cozy atmosphere. I tried a cheese burger and I have to admit that I had  problem to eat it! Huge portions and I think for reasonable prices. I am definitely comming back one day, excellent.;juil-17;Il Etait Un Square
1;Simply amazing burgers;5.0;My family and I were just looking for somewhere to grab some food for lunch, so I looked up this place on tripadvisor. It had great reviews saying how delicious it was so we thought we might give it a try. It totally lived up to all the reviews and was even better than I had hoped! They had a huge selection of all different types of things but we wanted burgers, there were six if I remember correctly. All three of us got different types, there were simple ones more interesting ones and crazy ones. Overall they were just delicious and make sure to order it at least medium if you don't want it super red inside the meat!;juil-17;Il Etait Un Square
1;Great burger and great service but that's it!!!;3.0;It's about fifteen mins when no traffic from rue scribe where we were staying ..... staff was great and super efficient ..... we ordered cheddar burgers , rib-eyes, Foie gras and the Gascon tartare and the small Cretan salad .... salad was average at best , foie gras below average , gascon tartare was average ..... the cheddar burger was actually outstanding and the only saving grace for the night and the rib eye was average ..... the service was fast and outstanding and also helped get us a taxi back to the hotel very fast ..... doesn't deserve a top twenty ranking in Paris but if you are a burger lover just go for the cheddar burger !!!;juil-17;Il Etait Un Square
1;One of the best burgers;5.0;The place is abit off but the staff was super friendly and the burgers are to die for. We got the when they where about to open and got a table right away but it got full fast so make a reservation.;juil-17;Il Etait Un Square
1;Dinner for 5!;5.0;Food was fabulous! All of us ordered burgers and we each cleared our plates completely! Service was very quick didn't have to wait long for food! I ate the cheddar burger and it was so tasty! Had homemade apple crumble for dessert which was delicious! Highly recommend for a relatively inexpensive dinner in Paris!;juil-17;Il Etait Un Square
1;Delish;5.0;Good was great and staff was very friendly. We enjoyed a Montangard burger and Garson Tartare both of which were excellent.;juil-17;Il Etait Un Square
1;Back again;5.0;Lovely meal, lovely restaurant! Lovely to see Gerard again! Had the Onglet brochette! Amazing meat, melt in the mouth! Tiramisu was amazing too!;juil-17;Il Etait Un Square
1;Beats any American burger;5.0;We recently visited Paris for a few days for our honeymoon and my husband found this burger place on here, so we went for a visit. It was AMAZING! It was better than any burger we have had back home in America. The secret is the cheese! It is so good. It was a bit of a hike out of the city center (we took an Uber) but it was well worth the trip! A must try if you are visiting, and if you could bring me one back, that would be great! I had the Cheddar burger and I'm pretty sure my husband had the Max burger, it had bacon on it.;juin-17;Il Etait Un Square
1;Great beef for burgers and great service;5.0;My wife and I had dinner there this evening and enjoyed it. The service was friendly and professional. The beef and fries were outstanding. Great value too. The tartares were a nice twist too and it works because their beef is so good.;juin-17;Il Etait Un Square
1;Great Food and Inviting;5.0;My daughter and I visited on a trip to Europe on our last evening in Paris based on other Trip Advisor reviews and proximity to our hotel. The burgers were absolutely delicious and the atmosphere very inviting. Our welcoming host was very friendly and a proud papa of two twin boys born today. Welcome to the world Antione and Roman!;juin-17;Il Etait Un Square
1;A must eat!;5.0;The meal was my absolute favorite meal in Europe. The French hamburger was thick, juicy and cooked to perfection. The egg on top made for a nice dipping sauce for the fries after the burger was finished. Excellent and attentive staff. I have recommended this restaurant to multiple colleagues traveling to Paris. Book your reservations online ahead of time to make sure you don't miss out!;juin-17;Il Etait Un Square

1;Excellent burgers and atmosphere;5.0;I came together with my clients on a conference trip and found this jewel. The restaurant is small, but we managed to get a table without booking. All of us got a different burger and shared a bottle of red wine.The food was excellent, service as well. The waiter even played piano for us! Best value for money defitinitely as the burgers cost 16 euros, red wine 34 euros and tasted excellent as well (rated 4.0 in Vivino);juin-17;Il Etait Un Square

1;Wonderful French interpretation of a burger;5.0;My husband and I ate at this restaurant on our recent trip to Paris. I was a little skeptical about eating hamburgers in France, but at the risk of being a traitor to my native United States, Il Etait Un Square might make the better burger! While some of their offerings are uniquely French (i ordered a blue cheese burger that included walnuts, and my husband's basic burger had cream of cheddar instead of cheddar), the experience was one of my favorites while in Paris. And their French fries are amazing.;mai-17;Il Etait Un Square
1;Awesome!;5.0;Arrived last Saturday on Il Etait Un Square without any reservation around 10pm, the owner told me they were fully booked so couldn't have a chance of checking the restaurant (My fault for not booking)This Monday I was around the area at 8pm and thought I could take a chance again, the owner immediately recognized me and offered me a table, this was quite unexpected and was very nice to see such a good customer experience.I ordered a starter and The Blue burger and had a lovely dinner, great value for the price. I totally understand why this place is so high on the ranking. Very Recommended.;mai-17;Il Etait Un Square
1;Delicious burgers and friendly welcoming;4.0;We had late lunch. Although we have not made a reservation they kindly showed us a table to wait. The burgers were nice and big. I would recommend for easy going people, if you are not looking for fancy tables and decotation this is a place to go. Thanks!;mai-17;Il Etait Un Square
1;An outstanding evening meal;5.0;Wow.. this is an amazing place. When we visited it was ranked 14 out of many thousands in Paris.... but should be placed at number 1.We enjoyed a beautiful recommended bottle of red wine with perfectly cooked steaks and were both doing our best to not finish the meal - it was so good we wanted to savour it as long as possible.Wonderful friendly service, close to the Paris Metro and just across from a lovely park.What a find - but please keep it quiet as we want to be able to book a table on our next visit.;mai-17;Il Etait Un Square
1;Really great;5.0;Seriously tasty and very reasonable for a place in Paris. Burgers were some of the best I've ever had. I highly recommend it;mai-17;Il Etait Un Square
1;Best Burgers!;5.0;After visiting the Catacombs, we searched for a place to eat.  These burgers were amazing.  I live the creamy cheese and the fries were also yummy.  The staff was friendly and the service was nice.;mai-17;Il Etait Un Square
1;Great Experience;5.0;I loved this place. To start off, our waiter was extremely nice and helpful in explaining the menu to us, and also some french culture. I decided to get a tartare since I never had one before, I was a little weary of the whole raw meat thing but the tartare was so good, and had great seasoning to it. Aside from this, we shared a bottle of wine and enjoyed the restaurant. It was a great time and I would come back if I am ever around again.;mai-17;Il Etait Un Square
1;Good Beef !! Nice price;4.0;It's a nice restaurant with good quality beef    And a reasonable price. Great hamburgers and nice steak tartar. Friendly atmosphere with a lovely and super service with no strings attached ! Go for it !!;mai-17;Il Etait Un Square
1;Great Food and Service;5.0;This place had amazing food. My family and I went in just expecting to eat burgers, but I ended up ordering a tartare, which was fantastic. They took the time to explain what makes their food special, and even made recommendations to us when we first sat down too which I loved. Also, it was a very easy place to find and travel to using the subway. I would highly recommend stopping by for a bite to eat! - The Armenians from Indiana;avr-17;Il Etait Un Square
1;Great food and happy service;5.0;We came at 20:30 oclock. We took the walk to come here, and that was a smart choice. Great food, good prices and very nice service. Rarely have i felt so easy treated and relaxed.;mai-17;Il Etait Un Square

1;Best Burgers!;5.0;"Great burgers! Amazing melted cheeses on the burgers in a relaxed atmosphere. Owner greeted and waited on us. French fries were also delicious! There was one kids option which we ordered for our 8 year old (basically a hamburger without the bun with french fries and a scoop of ice cream, which he liked very much). We had the apple dessert which was also very good. NOTE: in Paris a ""medium"" burger = ""medium rare"" in US, ""medium well"" burger = ""medium"" in US. My hubby couldn't get a well done burger anywhere to save his life despite saying ""no pink"", ""no blood"" etc. so be prepared.";avr-17;Il Etait Un Square
1;Good and fair price;5.0;We had a burger, very tasty. We also had a fish tartar, not bad but much better the burger. Good service. A bit remote the location bit doable.;avr-17;Il Etait Un Square
1;Overrated;2.0;I do not understand how rhis place is so high ratedThe tartare I had is just average and same for the friedParis offers so much more..This teaches me not to always follow the mass;avr-17;Il Etait Un Square
1;good food but overrated;4.0;As it was recommended by so many people I had to try it and travelled through whole Paris. The burgers are good but I had already betters. This shouldn't be a bad evaluation but if it's Place 9 of 14,000 restaurants in Paris I expect more! Service was very friendly and prices are very fair.;avr-17;Il Etait Un Square
1;Great food and very nice & friendly service;5.0;This place is rated very high on Tripadvisor and rightfully so.They specialize in burgers and tartare, and the quality of the food is excellent.Prices are not high, so value for money is superb.The owner is very chatty and personable, explained in detail what the different dishes were about, and surprised us with a complementary after-dinner drink. We arrived at 20:00and were the first customers, but by 21:00 almost all tables were taken, mostly by fairly young clientele.The location of the restaurant is a bit remote in the 13th arondissement, but only a short walk from metro stop Corvisart (line 6). All in all, a very pleasant experience.;avr-17;Il Etait Un Square
1;Delicious;5.0;Excellent service and lovely food. Nice ambience and popular with the locals. A small menu, but what they do, they do very well.;avr-17;Il Etait Un Square

1;Great Burgers!;5.0;My wife found this restaurant via Trip Advisor and the reviews don't lie. We ate at 1930, which is very early in France, however the waiter, who I also think was the owner, was very present and chatty. The food came quickly and was well cooked, well the wife's was as I had Stake Tartare which was perfect. The food is very reasonable priced as are the drinks. By 2030 it was full but the waiter still found time to talk. Well worth a visit but your have to book!;avr-17;Il Etait Un Square
1;Really nothing special;3.0;If you are in the neighbourhood and fancy a burger, by all means, go here. In any other circumstance, don't bother. We booked this because of the excellent reviews on Tripadvisor (no. 12 of all of Paris restaurants, now no.11!), but were very dissapointed. They serve burgers, that's it. And they are not anymore delicious or special than any other burger anywhere else, neither are the standard fries or the Heinz ketchup that is served straight out of the plastic bottle. The beverage selection is really terrible, as well. I really feel this is a joke to have this so high up on the list in a city known for its fantastic food. Please do not bother making a detour for this absolutely mediocre place.;avr-17;Il Etait Un Square
1;Best burger with friendly service;5.0;The place is quite near to Italy square and easy to find. I had the max burger and it is beyond my expectations. The flavor is excellent. Worth trying.;avr-17;Il Etait Un Square

1;BURGERS WITH ATTITUDE;5.0;This it truly where the simple burger meets the French mind and the results are by far the best burgers I have found anywhere , the owner and his staff are overly friendly and ready to serve you in any way to make you happy;mars-17;Il Etait Un Square
1;Excellent burger;5.0;Just returned from having a delicious chicken burger, fries and salad followed by apple crumble. We went due to good reviews on Trip Advisor and glad we did as the food was worth it. Good value, too. We may even go back before we return home.;mars-17;Il Etait Un Square
1;Full to bursting;3.0;We found this restaurant on Trip Advisor by searching for places to eat in our neighbourhood. As other reviewers have said, the burgers are good (but certainly not exceptional), great value, and the service was friendly and efficient. The complimentary aperitif at the end of the meal is a nice touch, but the harsh lighting meant that we were not tempted to linger over our coffee. In short, it's a burger joint, where portion sizes make up for lack of authentic atmosphere, but don't expect anything more.;mars-17;Il Etait Un Square
1;AMAZING VEGGIE BURGER;5.0;Food, service and prices all outstanding! A must-go if you want the options of steak and falafel side by side.;mars-17;Il Etait Un Square

1;Just what we wanted!;5.0;Burgers may not be what you think about eating during a visit to Paris, but as I had been craving a great burger for months, we did a little research and came upon Il Etait un Square. Made a reservation online using Trip Advisor, and glad that we did as people were turned away (it was a Friday night). Warmly welcomed into the restaurant and seated right away. The menu was explained clearly to us, in English, which was helpful. We order two burgers and were not disappointed. Burgers were huge, and came with fries in a cute little basket- and they were delicious as well! The tartare was interesting and ordered by many people around us, but I am not quite that brave!;févr-17;Il Etait Un Square
1;Delicious Burgers;5.0;My daughter and I had the pleasure of dinning at this wonderful restaurant. We were very warmly welcomed and quickly shown to our table. The menus were explained in depth, the focus being on the high quality of the beef and the delicious cheese sauces. We both ordered the butternut squash soup, delicious. This was followed by two very tasty burgers. The food, atmosphere and service were all exceptional. I would highly recommend this restaurant.;mars-17;Il Etait Un Square
1;Excellent family dining experience;5.0;Excellent. Came with my husband and four children while on a weekend holiday. We made our reservation using Trip Advisor (very handy!). The burgers were fantastic. The restaurant was clean and tidy. Nicolas even let us come in before the restaurant hours (we arrived 15 minutes earlier than our reservation and were waiting outside). Wonderful patience with our children and all around fantastic experience. Appreciated also that Nicolas spoke English, as it made it easier to ask questions about the food. Great experience.;mars-17;Il Etait Un Square

1;Hit the Spot;5.0;We were a group of Americans studying in Paris, and all us were missing home a bit. We had a reservation for 4, but 3 extra people came along. They said no problem, and fit a few tables together! Now on to the important part: the burgers! Delicious. Trust the American college students. They perfectly mixed the yummy, quality french cheese and meet with the traditional burger. Cannot recommend more. The restaurant has great service, great food (and dessert!), and is off the radar of tourists! Do yourself a favor and pop in.;févr-17;Il Etait Un Square
1;Great Tartares;5.0;They serve great tartare and with good selection as well, nice friendly staff. Their main specializations are tartare and burgers, they do it great and I would suggest to have some assortment of cheese with wine 'cause they offer it with great price;févr-17;Il Etait Un Square
1;Amazing burgers;4.0;Great place to come if you love meat, don't bother if you don't! The burgers we had were delicious and the melted cheese fondue that they put over the top was amazing. The chips were very good too. We also had a trio of desserts that were very tasty. The waiters were very friendly especially at the start when they had few customers. When it did get busy though, there were only 2 people serving and so service was very slow. This would be our only complaint though, it's definitely worth coming to if you love burgers!;févr-17;Il Etait Un Square
1;Cozy and delicious;5.0;Our meal and experience here were both excellent. The owner is very kind and charismatic, as well as the other staff. The service was wonderful, as everyone spoke English and were happy to explain the menu to us. Both the burger and the steak tartar were phenomenal. You even get complimentary limoncello after the meal, which was a great treat. Make sure you make a reservation! The couple who came in just before us were turned away because they did not have a reservation (even though at the time the place was not busy). Overall an excellent meal for a very reasonable price.;févr-17;Il Etait Un Square
1;Great burgers!;5.0;"We went here especially for the burgers. We tried ""The Max"". It was one of the best burgers we ever had. Gf was very excited about the cheese cream that was placed on her burger. She said it brought it to a next level. Also it's located in a district where not many tourists come.";févr-17;Il Etait Un Square
1;Burger me, this was good!;5.0;Phenomenal burgers! Exceptional flavours that work so well. They try combinations that are classical pairings but lie outside of the usual standard, tired offerings found in countless other restaurants and burger outlets. Quality ingredients cut through. Decent deserts and starters too all with excellent service. Worth discovering!;févr-17;Il Etait Un Square
1;Paris trip;4.0;First off, my son's girlfriend is a vegetarian but he is not.He really enjoyed his meal and although her options were limited so did his partner.Staff were friendly and accommodating and spoke fluent english and also provided an English menu without request.Would definitely recommend.;janv-17;Il Etait Un Square
1;Really good burgers;4.0;The burgers were really good but not excellent/amazing. None of us 3 had the tartar which may have been amazing. It is worth visiting the place nevertheless. Service was excellent, nothing to complain about. But the quality of the food sure doesn't warrant the restaurant's current top 10 in Paris place.;janv-17;Il Etait Un Square
1;Loved it;5.0;This was a cool place.  A great spot for something different in Paris and an excellent burger (I had the Max) at a great price.  The owner was friendly and it was a good experience all around.;janv-17;Il Etait Un Square
1;Love this place;5.0;This place is awesome. The only drawback was that the food came out quick and I couldn't spend more time here. Very relaxing and casual. My waitress, Jeanne, was great. I had the French hamburger with fried egg and cheddar. Order it medium and cooked perfectly. Used the fries to soak up all the leftover juices, egg and cheddar. The small green salad was a nice touch. Price was great for Paris. Next time I stop in I'm trying the tartare. If you're coming to Paris for the French cuisine you'll probably not end up here. But if you stop here you will always go back.;janv-17;Il Etait Un Square

1;Not sure why people rave about it;3.0;Ok so since this place is rated so high on trip advisor, I thought the place would blow my mind. Just your average burger with average toppings. Average fries. The only thing that wasn't average was the price. 16 euros or about $20 for a so so burger. Guess I've eaten a lot of great burgers on my time. These just didn't rate. Dessert was good though;janv-17;Il Etait Un Square
1;Awesomeeeeeeeee!;5.0;Let see!! How should we started...we were there in summer 2016 from SAN JUAN PUERTO RICO. The service was excellent,and the food ufff!!!delicious. The place was very centric and comfortable. the manager and was very friendly. My husband was in love with the Russian style burger. Believe me!! in PR we've a lot of good places of burgers, but this place really surprised us... We're planning going again to PARIS and of course LL ETAIT will be our first option to eat!!!;juil-16;Il Etait Un Square
1;Amazing place;5.0;Best burgers and tartars. Excellent chips. Witty owner. Even my wife accepts to have dinner with me in this cozy place. What to ask for more?;déc-16;Il Etait Un Square
1;Ever greater;5.0;If this is my second review in two years, it's because I keep coming back to this unique restaurant. Faithful to their constant quest for quality and client satisfaction, the owners of Il Était Un Square have added to their menu another creative hamburger and several other dishes worth discovering. Two more red wines were also added very recently, both exquisite.Still one of the best restaurants in Paris.;nov-16;Il Etait Un Square
1;Epic burgers and tartars;5.0;Especially the day specials with fouis gras were amazing. Restaurant looks pretty modern so no real French romantic nostalgia here. This is all about the food with a modern look and good service.;déc-16;Il Etait Un Square
1;Excellent!;5.0;Arranged online for a reservation. Met at the door by the friendly owner/manager.... taken to my table and couldn't be happier! Delicious burger accompanied by terrific fries and some nice greens on the side. The glass of red wine that I chose went perfectly. Not too fancy... delicious choice of burgers and tartare! Nice atmosphere! And again, very friendly staff.;déc-16;Il Etait Un Square
1;A pleasant return;5.0;The location of the restaurant – within easy walking distance of the Marriott Rive Gauche Hotel and the Metro (down the block from the Corvisart station), and the good reviews on Trip Advisor were the reasons we first dined at the restaurant a year ago. For the same reasons and our favorable first time experience, we returned several weeks ago. The burger offerings come with an interesting variety of toppings and melted cheeses such as reblochon, cheddar, etc. They were tasty and prepared to order and the buns were very good (you can order without the bun). The fries were delicious and a salad was a nice accompaniment. We arrived at 7:00, 30 minutes before opening, but the owner/manager? was kind enough to go ahead and seat us and was personable in tending to all his customers. The food and overall experience were such that we would return again.;nov-16;Il Etait Un Square
1;Great;5.0;We got the mountain burger and the blue cheese burger. Excellent quality meat and very dedicated server. Price is wonderful for the quality, a great find!;nov-16;Il Etait Un Square

1;Great Food, Exceptional Service;5.0;I just got back from the restuarant and the wait staff there made such a lasting impression on me. They were courteous, helpful, attentive, and really made someone feel welcome into their space. The food was top notch. I got the tartare based on the waiter's reccomendation and it was exceptionally good. Would reccomend.;nov-16;Il Etait Un Square
1;Love this place!;5.0;Can't say enough about this restaurant! Delicious food and fantastic service! Both my husband and I had burgers off of the menu that were flavorful and juicy. We had such a good experience the first time that we went back again 3 days later. I highly recommend making this place a stop during your stay in Paris!;oct-16;Il Etait Un Square
1;WOW, just a great meal;5.0;I was there with my wife and three kids and everyone loved everything they ate. We tried a variety of burgers and tartars and found were some of the best we have had. It was fabulous for its simplicity.;août-16;Il Etait Un Square
1;Good Quality - Perfect service;5.0;I was there yesterday. I was impressed by the courtesy but above all for the impressive and tasty hamburgers they have. I strongly reccomend this place, which is not that far from the metro. Giuseppe;oct-16;Il Etait Un Square
1;Very good burger, Great service;4.0;Really good service, the burger was great as well, the only thing was the beef and the melted cheese were over very heavy and I would have liked the burger to be a bit lighter. Otherwise very good burger joint n the top 10 burgers in paris for sure.;oct-16;Il Etait Un Square
1;Best Burger?;5.0;Please advise of any better burger anywhere! I am not holding my breath!  The chips aren't too sloppy either.;oct-16;Il Etait Un Square
1;Amazing;5.0;Thats really a 5 stars restaurant - a very well done beef for the burger and tartare they do . Amazing taste - really fresh - i highly recommend - I tried one of their burgers and would go back to try them all.;oct-16;Il Etait Un Square
1;Very nice & recommendable;5.0;We chose this restaurant because of it's location close to our flat, as well as the outrageous reviews here on TripAdvisor. The staff is very nice, knows their job well and does everything for your comfort. The food was as expected extremely tasty! We had a burger and an exotic salat, both can be recommended!;oct-16;Il Etait Un Square
1;I Love this Place!;5.0;I love this place! My favorite is the et tartare, always a new spice and delicious flavor and great burgers too! This is one of my favorite cafes, in additions to great food, the staff Gerard & Nicolas always make me feel so welcome and speak much, much better English than I do French. The restaurant is an easy Metro location, the community is very neighborly. Square Rene le Gall is a close walk via cobblestone streets and there you will find a beautiful Rose Garden. Go see Gerard & Nicolas, GREAT Food! I come here everytime I am in Paris, they make me feel so welcomed!Yvonne. San Francisco;oct-16;Il Etait Un Square
1;Excellent!!!;5.0;"The food was awesome. The burgers are huge and the taste ""out of World"". The manager and the waiters were very friendly. We stayed several days in Paris and we went to the restaurant 3 Times..100%recommended.. We're from Puerto Rico and we lo ve and enjoy a good seasoning,we don't find a better place in Paris.";juil-16;Il Etait Un Square
1;Best burger in Europe to follow the Catacombs visit;5.0;Ok so I've only had 4 Burgers in this 3 week trip across Italy and France. But this Burger was to die for. 150g of premium shaved beef that would be suitable for steak tartare. We ordered medium and it was more medium rare and we were glad that it was. But if you don't want serious pink then order well done. Anyway we had the chef special and whatever that cheese was, I can't remember, but it dripped off the burger and just made it. Caramelised onions, tomato, lettuce and crispy smoked bacon. Wow. My son and I didn't say a word through the whole lunch. The accompanying fries were perfect and crispy. 16€ each. Couldn't fault it. Possibly the roll could have been slightly fresher as it crumbled a little but I'm just being picky. I am a bread snob. Service was outstanding. I ordered a coffee and was offered a lemincelo on the house which I accepted and it was a nice finale. I would thoroughly recommend for an awesome burger lunch after the catacombs. Only a short walk from there.;sept-16;Il Etait Un Square
1;Excellent!!!;5.0;I went here with my boyfriend because I saw all the reviews of how good the food is and they did not disappoint! Not only did I have the best service here out of any of the places while in France but my burger was delicious. It was too big for me to finish and the server even wanted to bring me a new dish because he thought I didn't like it. He wanted to make sure I had an amazing experience. Truly excellent staff! A must eat place!;sept-16;Il Etait Un Square
1;Really Great Place;5.0;Went on a Monday as lots of places in Paris were closed for dinner, but would go again no matter the day of the week. Service was great. The burgers were awesome. And we never felt rushed even though we ended up closing the place. Definitely recommended for anyone in Paris looking for a meal with some high quality beef.;sept-16;Il Etait Un Square
1;Great tartares and burgers;5.0;We went there for lunch. As we arrived early the very friendly staff took the time to guide us through the menu.You really have to try the tartares and the burgers. Both are great. Perhaps this is because they have the same butcher like the president :-) Overall a perfect experience.Go and visit!!;sept-16;Il Etait Un Square
1;Amazing beef...even better than Alberta!;5.0;With so many restaurants in Paris, it's difficult to pick one, unless you narrow your desires to categories. Of course, every one has an opinion about a restaurant, but we had a hankering for a good burger and decided to come here. Because they do tartare, I assumed they knew how to handle ground beef. I am very fussy about my meat, where its sources and how it's cooked, but for some odd reason, I felt comfortable giving this place a shot. Being from cattle country in Calgary, Alberta, I thought we had the best beef. Hmmm, guess FrNce produces some pretty fine beef as well.Well, OMG, did we do well picking Il Etat un Square. We picked the burger of the month, and every aspect if it was delicious. The heirloom tomatoes had taste, the bun was as you would expect from a French bakery, the caramelized red onions and the cheddar cheese sauce made my palate sing! Also nice, was the English speaking owners, who didn't lay any guilt trip on us for not speaking French...merci, for that. They even had their menu in English...and not the kind restaurants used to have. I remember if you asked for an English menu, you got choices different from the one they gave their countrymen. No hidden, secret food, no crappy choices, just the English version so you could order like everyone else.( no translator app required)The burger came with a fresh green salad and fries, and if you were hungry after that, their desserts looked divine. We didn't indulge as there just wasn't room enough. Everyone around us seemed very happy with their choices, so I can only assume they excelled in this area as well. You gotta try this place. This ain't no Burger King, kids...it's the real , finger licking, lick your plate kind of food! If you don't like it, I will be very shocked! By the way, the ambiance was welcoming and fun as well, and they seemed to really appreciate my business. Bon appetite!;sept-16;Il Etait Un Square
1;Best burgers I've tasted;5.0;I have eaten a lot of burgers at a lot of different places all around the world and I can without a doubt say that this is the place with the best burgers. The meat is in a good quality. They have a slightly cooked tarte for people who does not want to eat it completely raw. I tried it and it was amazing too. The staff was very kind and lovely. Best regards from a Swedish friend, hope to see you again soon.;sept-16;Il Etait Un Square
1;Great burgers;5.0;Great burgers, great tartares, if you have any taste go there! Cooks that know their trade! No worries!;sept-16;Il Etait Un Square
1;Very good burger;5.0;We went to lunch on excursion from work meeting. We found this great cafe on TripAdvisor and enjoyed great service and a great hamburger. We got the mountain burger and the blue cheese burger. Excellent quality meat and very dedicated server. We highly recommend this restaurant.;sept-16;Il Etait Un Square
1;Fantastic food!;5.0;Absolutely amazing food. I had a burger and my girlfriend had steak tartar, both were seriously impressed with the quality of the food.Price is wonderful for the quality, we had our mains along with a bottle of red wine and was under €70 Wonderful service! Knowledgeable waiter who spoke perfect English. Explained the entire menu to us.Would recommend 10/10Only reason this rating isn't 10/10 is due to the restaurant being quiet, the atmosphere wasn't exactly electric but I believe we are as much to blame as we came at 7:30 as soon as the restaurant opened.;sept-16;Il Etait Un Square
1;Pearl in Paris;5.0;Great to follow Tripadvisor and find out that it can be even better than expected still!! We went to eat at Il Etait Un Square with six colleagues. The burgers (burger of the month with caramelized onion rings and chedar..), tartare and foie gras were outstanding. Service was as good as mentioned in all reviews and the owner is very friendly. Nice wine, good coffee. Limoncello from the house... Well worth visiting: want to eat a burger? Must try Il Etait Un Square.;sept-16;Il Etait Un Square
1;Lovely meal;5.0;Yet again we had a lovely meal in Paris in il etait un square. We went last year and it was fab. We had a great burger, service was fantastic and Gerard and Nicolas were amazing. This time I went with my 3,5 little boy as daddy had to go back to work in England! Lovely mummy and son meal. He had a steak haché frites and I had tartare Italien which was amazing. Great service and the atmosphere was superb! Thanks again for a lovely meal without daddy! Lol;août-16;Il Etait Un Square
1;Very good food, kind people and a nice restaurant;4.0;An unexpected restaurant specialised in burgers an tartare. Most of us had the burgers and I had a tartare. There is also steaks but non of us had it. The burgers were good and I liked the tartare. Definitely better burgers than in an average burger restaurant. The service is good and although they were full, they created a table for the 7 of us. All was served quickly. One mistake with the order, so one of us had to wait. The prices are ok.;sept-16;Il Etait Un Square
1;Best lunch in Paris;5.0;We just visited this lovely restaurant in Paris for the second time and I am pleased to inform it is even better now, the owners always go out of the way to make sure you are looked after. There was a mix of clientele, families travellers and workers and we had salads and a steak haché that was cooked to perfection. The burgers look amazing, the next time we are in Paris this will be out first stop and not our last.;août-16;Il Etait Un Square
1;what a find;5.0;We booked this restaurant after reading the Trip Advisor reviews and were not disappointed. It is somewhat out of the centre of Paris but, rather than a 15 minute metro ride, we took the opportunity to walk from our hotel by the Opera all the way through the Latin Quarter and on to the suburbs. On the way we even found the hotel close to the Jardin du Luxembourg where we had honeymooned 47 years ago! On arrival we had a drink outside on a beautiful summer evening and watched life passing by in a suburban Paris street, with a lovely park opposite. It so warm and perfect that we decided to eat outside. The food was amazing! The menu is largely different kinds of hamburger or steak tartare. my wife and I both had different hamburgers and they were to die for - absolutely delicious! We would not hesitate to go there again next time we're in Paris. The staff were all delightful as well, and so friendly - they did not treat us like tourists at all. A great find!;août-16;Il Etait Un Square
1;Great dinner at Il Etait Un Square;5.0;This is a great restaurant located slightly away from the city center but well worth the trip for wonderful food and great service. My boyfriend and I each had fantastic burgers here. The service was very friendly and menus are available in English. We had a great time here and would recommend to anyone looking for a casual setting with very good food.;août-16;Il Etait Un Square
1;Excellent food even better service!;5.0;The staff are very friendly and helpful with selection of your meal or any questions you may have. The food is of a stellar quality and you will be surprised at how decent the pricing is for what you receive. I suggest you take them up on their dessert options as well!;août-16;Il Etait Un Square
1;Food is wonderful, service is even better.;5.0;We stumbled upon this lovely restaurant one evening and were welcomed straight away by the manager, he had us seated right away and looked after us all evening. Even though my French is sadly not up to scratch he was more than happy to talk in English and help with my French. The food was amazing, the best burger I have ever had, the cheese in the centre kept it nice and moist.I cannot recommend this place enough, we will be back to try more.;juil-16;Il Etait Un Square
1;delicious food;5.0;I was amazed by the food served here. Everything I tried was delicious. I definitely recommend this everyone. Next time I come to Paris I will go to this restaurant again.;juin-16;Il Etait Un Square
1;Good but not High Class;3.0;Had the Max Burger here. The burger meat was good quality medium rare as ordered, taste was nice but not extraordinary. Overall I would say it is just a better burger and tartare restaurant, but not more.;juil-16;Il Etait Un Square
1;You have to go;5.0;They have a large variety of food, the burgers are extraordinary. If you are in paris and don't know where to eat you should come here and try one of their burgers.;juil-16;Il Etait Un Square
1;Hamburger The Max;5.0;Excellent. Best hamburger in town! Loved the service and place. The Max hamburger is definetely the best #Exquisite. Go there;juil-16;Il Etait Un Square
1;Great burgers and tartare!;5.0;Our family of 5 visited based on the strong TripAdvisor reviews. I had the beef tartare - lightly cooked on the top and infused with their homemade foie gras - outstanding! Rest of the family all had burgers and declared them among the best they've ever had. Owner was also very friendly. Definitely worth the trip to the 13th arrondissement - great experience all around.;juil-16;Il Etait Un Square
1;WOW;5.0;No words Can describe how I feel ! .. I'm still at the restaurant, My phone is greasy from my still not washed hands ! I have to write this review now as I feel Im in heaven! go for the cheddar burger its simple at great . if you are a barbecue lover you will not regret ordering the Cajun burger.;juil-16;Il Etait Un Square
1;Excellent in every way!;5.0;We visited the fabulous establishment on our first trip to Paris and we loved it and will be back again. We did not have reservation and the owners worked us in. The food, the customer service, the attention to detail was wonderful From start to finish, everything was great. We had the Le Cajun Chicken and the Cheddar burger and both were great. We are leaving soon, but we may have to make one more trip before we go. To the owners, keep doing what you are doing! The Florida Couple...w/o the reservation:-);juil-16;Il Etait Un Square
1;Our Best Meal In Paris;5.0;This place is amazing. When you think of Paris, you don't really think of hamburgers - but this is the exception. They were really busy, but the owners were friendly and hustling around as quickly as they could. The food was certainly worth the wait.Go there!!!;juil-16;Il Etait Un Square

Great ambience and environment, good for family and friends Thanks for a wonderful meal and experience!!!;juil-16;Il Etait Un Square
1;"""Great burger and great service!""";5.0;I read other reviews and decided to take my fiancée there for dinner. It was worth the metro (train) ride from the Louvre. If you want a great tasting burger (We are from ATL and NYC and these burgers are better than many of the speciality burger places in both cities.) with friendly owners/staff then get to this restaurant before it gets too popular and you have to make a reservation.;juil-16;Il Etait Un Square

1;Excellent hamburgers;4.0;Went with the family on July 5. The hamburgers were excellent. I had a chicken hamburger which was very tasty. The French fries were so so. I like thin crispy fries but these were not as this as I like them. The Tiramisu afterwards was delightful. Overall a nice experience.;juil-16;Il Etait Un Square

As soon as I was seated, my waiter came by the table and explained the menu to me item by item. I chose the Max burger, it was very good. The meat was great. They get their beef from one of Paris' top butchers and you can taste the difference.;juin-16;Il Etait Un Square

1;Delicious Burger;5.0;We were glad we took the time to visit. We were there for lunch so the restaurant was quiet. The burger was delicious.

1;"""Now that's a tasty burger!!""";5.0;We visited L'etait un square whilst on a family trip and thoroughly enjoyed our evening! Its a simple and casual cafe style burger bar with a small but mouthwatering menu - we all went for The Max burger and all cleaned our plates! We also tried the steak tartare to start and again, this was the best I've ever tasted - really fresh and authentic french flavours. We mentioned it was my father in laws birthday and they gave him a bottle of Nicholas Feuillatte champagne as a gift when we were leaving! Friendly service and good beer to accompany the food made it a perfect and relaxing evening... Certainly a place i would go back to! Thank you guys!;juin-16;Il Etait Un Square
1;Very good burgers;4.0;We went there for dinner, luckily as we were only 3 people they had a table for us but it is highly recommended to book a few days earlier. We had burgers, all of which were great, very tasty and generous portions.However there was only 1 waiter for all the tables so it took him ages to give us the menu, then to take the order, and finally to give us the cheque which took them 40 minutes. Nevertheless the waiter was very friendly and helpful.I would recommend this restaurant for its excellent food but not if you're in a rush.;mai-16;Il Etait Un Square
1;Burgerlicious!;5.0;Went for the burgers and tartare and we were not disappointed. Meat locally sourced and obviously selected with care.Burger done perfectly to request, patty just the right thickness and dribbling with signature cheesiness. The tartare was rustic, herbs fresh and traditional ingredients chopped just above fine, making it fresh and flavoursome. Probably the best tartare I've sampled recently. Menu is short and simple but enough to cover even the vegetarian! Wines were inexpensive and pared well. Although I went with my partner at 9.30pm on a Tues night they were quite full with groups of both business and friends. We'd booked but the kitchen is open until 9.45-10 even during week.The rooms were full of locals and foreigners and the atmosphere was inviting and so were the cousins who run the place. As an Australian frequently visiting Paris, I'll definitely be back here.;mai-16;Il Etait Un Square
1;Amazing burgers like none I've tried anywhere else;5.0;The meat was delicious and perfectly cooked. The staff were attentive and wanted to make sure we had the best time and experience while there. It was an unforgettable experience.;mai-16;Il Etait Un Square
1;You have to go!!!;5.0;Finally we found a place where we can speak english in Paris. The owners are very kind.The food and wine are so special. We really suggest you to go there. One Burger (the max), One traditional tartare, two glasses of wine and as dessert a homemade tiramisù ....50€.;mai-16;Il Etait Un Square
1;Best burger in paris !;5.0;Casual restaurant with superb quality burgers and tartare. My husband had the burger and said it was the best he's ever had.

1;Best meat and friendly service;5.0;We have chosen the Il Etait Un Square restaurant because of the fantastic Trip Advisor rating. We booked a table for two at 9pm but we were a little bit early. That wasn't a problem and so we took a seat in the little restaurant. It was a nice cosy atmosphere and the waiter was very friendly. He gave us the menus in English and explained the burgers and Tartar. Also, he recommend some drinks for us. The meat is from one of the best butcher of Paris. We took the salad and goat cheese starter with honey and afterwards two burgers. The starter was awesome and the meat of the burgers very delicious. I ate Panacotta as dessert which was tasty as well. We really recommend this restaurant and its waiters. Thanks for the nice food and drink!;mai-16;Il Etait Un Square

1;Red Robin USA;2.0;Great reviews but does not rate #4 in Paris. Red Robin in the USA makes better burgers! The French fries are like McDonalds. Burger was good but nothing special. I had the Max burger. Don't waste your time here!';mai-16;Il Etait Un Square
1;Great place for burger.;5.0;I had a burgerMax, it was very cool.Combination of the taste was amazing, I really enjoyed it.Bread, meat, cheese... everything was super great.But one thing I was missing was bacon. If this burger could be with fat, soft bacon.. That will be magic.You definately need to go try!;avr-16;Il Etait Un Square
1;Great food great service!;5.0;Worth the trip! We were here on vacation and tried it due to the high trip advisor rating. After coming I can see why they had the great reviews. Delicious burger, with all local ingredients and desert was also very good.;avr-16;Il Etait Un Square
1;One of the best meat I have ever eat;5.0;"I chose the traditional tartare on manager advises and it was an absolutely lovely surprise. Meat is very incredible, and the team is very nice. I know that my friends loved burgers that they choose too, so I mean that you cannot go around ""Les Gobelins"" in Paris without going to this restaurant.";avr-16;Il Etait Un Square

1;Great staff and an even better burger;5.0;Visited this place after reading the reviews, and was not at all disappointed.

1;Burgers With a Twist;5.0;From the moment we walked in, we were greeted by someone who you could tell really cared about providing a great dining experience. We took two burgers, the cheese burger, which is not your typical cheeseburger and the cajun chicken burger. Personally, I preferred the cajun chicken burger because I felt it had more interesting flavours but both dishes were excellent, although a little too small, so if you're really hungry, you might want to order an appetizer.I'll definitely be back here on my next trip to Paris to try out their tartare, which also seems to be very popular based on other diners' tables.;févr-16;Il Etait Un Square
1;Amazing service and quality food.;5.0;The service was amazing, the staff were so polite, vibrant and bubbly and extremely welcoming. The food was top notch, definitely an amazing end to an excellent trip to Paris! Thank-you so much guys!!!;févr-16;Il Etait Un Square
1;Banging burgers;5.0;With a penchant for Napoleon and David Bowie the owner of this great little burger joint can't be more welcoming. The burgers and tartares are outstanding - especially if you like your burger bloody! Quick service but definitely not your standard burger and chips. Book ahead to avoid disappointment. This will soon be one of the top 10 restaurants in Paris.;févr-16;Il Etait Un Square
1;Ok;4.0;This place hase a nice wiev and in the street you can see a lot of different people walking having fan the meal incredbe nice and warm;janv-16;Il Etait Un Square
1;Simple but good;5.0;My wife and I went there for lunch as we were visiting the area. We each had a formula of the day, which was simple but nice food for a very reasonable price. The wine by the glass was also excellent. And because it was just before Christmas, we had a complimentary piece of foie gras with a glass of muscat (sweet white wine). The staff was very nice and efficient. We arrived just after two groups of people so expected the service to take a long time but it was actually very quick. All in all, a very nice experience we strongly recommend.;déc-15;Il Etait Un Square
1;Varun;4.0;Good vegetarian burger. Sauces could be improved and fries could have more options. Good for lunches slightly hidden but easy access by metro. Gerard at the bar is a good talker.;déc-15;Il Etait Un Square
1;Wonderful find! Incredible tartare;5.0;Il Etait Un Square was a great find! The food was delicious and the environment was relaxing. I recommend Le Thai for tartare (delicious!) and the housemade tiramisu for dessert--one of the best I've had!I don't expect restaurants to ever cater to English speakers over their natives languages, and I happily like to utilize my French when possible, but it was fantastic that the owner of the restaurant was so welcoming, accommodating, and more than happy to provide us with English menus.It's a couple metro stops from the Center, but worth the trip. One of my favorite places I've been to in Paris.;déc-15;Il Etait Un Square
1;Not satisfactory;3.0;We have been there for dinner, wine was very ordinary, we had hamburgers which we found very average in terms of taste;oct-15;Il Etait Un Square
1;Worth the hassle of the address;4.0;The first thing to say is that whilst it is quite some distance from the centre, south of the Rive gauche of Paris and not an easy place to find it is definitely worth it. Very nice staff welcome you to a place which looks a little like an old fashioned bar with food in a small French town. Do not be put off. The tartars and burgers are just sensational and I can honestly say I was amazed. My wife had the Burger gourmand with melted reblochon and said it was the best burger she has ever had. I had tartare Gascon with, fois gras, cornichons and other ingredients. Totally delicious. Actually more than delicious and I am drooling writing this. Cannot wait to have an opportunity to go back. Cost was €74 inclusive first, main and bottle of wine. Great value.;déc-15;Il Etait Un Square
1;Yummy Yum;5.0;If you are a Burger or Tartare lover do not miss this place! Best burger in Paris... Try the cheddar burger and the TAÏ Tartare out of this world. Service is very friendly and they speak English. Prior booking is a must. Prices are average (photos attached);déc-15;Il Etait Un Square
1;A Great Way to Begin a 10 day Holiday!!!!;5.0;Food and service were excellent! Host and bartender were awesome. Very friendly and attentive even as it got crowded. Host played the piano and took photos while the meal was being prepared. Just a very nice place to have an excellent burger;oct-15;Il Etait Un Square
1;Great food and Tremendous Service;5.0;I'm not much of a food reviewer. It's either good or it's not, so my review focuses more on service. The staff was tremendously welcoming to non-French speakers and took the time to walk us through the menu. The meal was great and I know we'll be stopping by again next time we make it to Paris. Make sure to try the tiramisu.;nov-15;Il Etait Un Square
1;Good burger place;4.0;I went here because of the incredibly high reviews but was a bit disappointed. Actually this is a very good place for a burger in the 13th, but it is definitely not the 9th best restaurant in Paris and I don't understand why it is so high in the ranking! Without this ranking, I would probably have given 5 stars: good products, nice portions, awesome dessert, very nice staff... But honestly it is too much to put it 9th total Paris. Which won't stop me from coming back again as soon as I go in the 13th!;nov-15;Il Etait Un Square
1;Great food. Fun night.;5.0;During our vacation in Paris, my wife and I had an enjoyable dinner at II Etait Un Square. We both had the Cheddar Burger and it was cooked perfectly - overall it was an excellent burger, it is served with delicious french fries and salad. We couldn’t resist ordering the tiramisu for dessert, which was the best we have ever had. Gerard, the owner, was very helpful as we spoke very little French. We had such a good time that we returned at the end of the week for another great meal. Elisa was our waitress and was also very helpful. Gerard even played a song on his piano for us – he is quite good and such a nice guy! We would highly recommend Il Etait Un Square - you will not be disappointed. Merci Gerard and Elisa! Your friends from Boston.;oct-15;Il Etait Un Square
1;Great burgers and service!;4.0;Hi!  This restaurant is good, they have great burgers, wine... The staff is very nice and welcoming as well. I went there with friends and we all loved it!;nov-15;Il Etait Un Square
1;Nice place, good steak tartare!;4.0;We arrived on an early Saturday evening without reservation. Despite being fully booked the very kind couple that recieved us gave us a table for two. The restaurant quickly filled of with young couples, clearly coming there for the nice burgers. We came for the steak tartares though. The restaurant specializes in them an hes some six variations on offer. Being steak tartare virgins we opted for the 'nature' version: lovely and tasty, accompanied by decent fries and good Broully wine. Go there for the nice people and the good steak tartare!;oct-15;Il Etait Un Square
1;Great burgers in a friendly setting.;5.0;The burgers are really good. Really can't fault them. Friendly service and atmosphere. I will leave feeling full and relaxed. Thank you!;nov-15;Il Etait Un Square
1;AMAZING PLACE;5.0;We saw this restaurant after doing some research on TripAdvisor and I am so happy to have found it! Our reservation was at 9:30pm and we were running late, so we called and said we might not make it before the 10pm closing time. They told us that they would leave the kitchen open for us so we could eat! The atmosphere is a small cafe, you would never guess that they would serve burgers there. The owner was gracious, accommodating and overall a really awesome guy. The burgers were made perfectly, I got the max burger which was well-priced for what it was - a gourmet burger with a basket of really good fries. I would absolutely recommend this place to anyone and everyone.;oct-15;Il Etait Un Square
1;Best place to have lunch;5.0;After a long journey I was feeling very hungry for my good I found a restaurant where I got one of the best lunch I have ever had And also the environment was very peaceful;oct-15;Il Etait Un Square
1;Great casual dining;5.0;GREAT burgers! Several types to choose from. Really reasonable (maybe even cheap) wine list. They offered several different steak tartars on the menu but we didn't try any of them. Service was terrific and very friendly (we are not French speakers, and it was no problem). This place is a little off the beaten path, so allow yourself a little extra time to get there.;oct-15;Il Etait Un Square
1;GOOD BURGER;4.0;This place is a delicious burger joint in a great location. I had a home burger, french fries come with the burger and they have a special sauce with it. The special sauce is a really good. The staff is super helpful and they speak English. Highly recommended.;juil-15;Il Etait Un Square
1;Casual dining in Paris!;5.0;We went to this restaurant because of the great reviews on tripadvisor and it did not disappoint. For those of you who have never dined here, just an fyi that this is a burger joint. The owner waited on all of the tables. He was extremely friendly and very chatty. It was a nice change because we all know that some Parisians do not like Americans. He gave us restaurant recommendations for the other nights that we were going to be in town. We started out with the crete salad. It was simple but really delicious. I had the montagnard burger which was very heavy. There was a lot of cheese and a lot of ham on this burger but it was really good. For dessert we ordered the tiramisu and it lived up to its reputation. It was delicious. I would definitely recommend this restaurant if you are looking for a casual ambience with casual but delicious food.;sept-15;Il Etait Un Square
1;Average;3.0;Nice place and a very welcoming englishspeaking staff. Not the best burgers we've ever tasted (too cheesy), but totally okey for that price. Worth a visit. We also got a free shot on our way out as a nice gesture.;oct-15;Il Etait Un Square
1;Amazing food;5.0;Stopped by for a quick bite with friends visiting Paris for the first time. Food was incredible!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!;oct-15;Il Etait Un Square
1;Delicious burger off the beaten track;4.0;We tried this place due to the great reviews and the burgers did not disappoint. The owner/ host was lovely and attentive. It's important to note that the restaurant itself is not near much, it's off the beaten track...but if you are after a really yummy burger it's worthwhile. The Montagnard was really delicious!;sept-15;Il Etait Un Square
1;Good food, great service;4.0;Owner /host was charming and extremely hospitable. Fries were very good. The burger itself was very similar to what I'd make--better than most burgers. Went on a weeknight and the place wasn't crowded.;sept-15;Il Etait Un Square
1;The BEST burger ever;5.0;We found this place after raving reviews on TA! We walked about an hour to get to this restaurant and it was definitely worth every minute! My husband LOVES burgers and so I made reservations via email, and they were very responsive. Either the owner or the owner's brother came out and gave us a summary of their menu and we decided on the blue cheese burger for myself, and the cheddar cheese burger. The beef was exceptional and melted in my mouth, the burger bun was slightly crispy on the outside but like butter in the inside, and the blue cheese was dripping with every bite. The flavours of everything together in my mouth was exceptional. This was probably one of my favourite things to eat in Paris. Should not be missed!! Would definitely be one of the places to visit again if we go back to Paris! Au revoir for now, il etait un square!!;sept-15;Il Etait Un Square
1;Very Welcoming Atmosphere & Amazing Food;5.0;We were immediately greeted by the owner who throughly went over the menu. They specialize in burgers and tartare so we got one of each. And yes, I did get a burger (The Max) in Paris - it was AMAZING and was cooked to perfection. Also the homemade tiramisu was the best I've ever had! We are from Hawaii and the family atmosphere helped us fit right in. Thank you so much to all the owner and staff for your hospitality. We also had an opportunity to get a caricature painting done after dinner. We had a blast!;sept-15;Il Etait Un Square
1;Great food & nice service!;5.0;Nice friendly service, the steak tartare are delicious & home-made tiramisu is amazing! Didnt try the burgers but they sound really nice!;sept-15;Il Etait Un Square

1;Great food, friendly host;5.0;Had a great burger here and an excellent homemade tiramisu. The host is really friendly, overall a great experience!;sept-15;Il Etait Un Square
1;Very delicious burger with fresh ingredients!;5.0;We found this restaurant on TripAdvisor and decided to give it a shot. Very pleasant surprise and glad we took the trip via the Metro. The owner was very pleasant to talk to and quite personable.The burger was absolutely delicious! Meat and vegetables very fresh and definitely one of the best meals we had in Paris. Definitely will dine here again next time we are in town.;juil-15;Il Etait Un Square
1;Good food!;5.0;It worth a try! Located by a nice park, this place is good for hamburger! That's what I tried! The bread is very good and I advice to try the burger with cheese from mountains can't remember the name, but ask the owner .) before he close he plays piano!;juil-15;Il Etait Un Square

1;Sooo good!!;5.0;Delicious food! You should definitely go here. The servers and owners are so nice and our large group of friends had a great experience.;juin-15;Il Etait Un Square
1;Trust the positive reviews!;5.0;Trust the positive reviews. We did, and in spite of being well out of our way, this place is a wonderful treat. The staff is perfectly courteous and welcoming, the atmosphere is superb and the food was terrific. My wife and I both had burgers and they were magnificent. We will be making this a regular stop for us when we travel through Paris.;juin-15;Il Etait Un Square
1;Decent burgers;4.0;We visited this small unassuming restaurant recently and enjoyed the burgers very much. Cooked to order, there was a variety of burgers to choose from and they showed imagination in the choice provided. Food and service were good and it was fairly similar in price to other meals we had in this area. Although we did not book we got a table ok but the restaurant became busier as it got later. I had a lovely goats cheese and honey salad which was fresh, tasty and good value. There are a small selection of desserts to choose from and the tiramisu was particularly delicious. Worth noting that on the day we went the restaurant did not open in the evening until 7.30pm.;mai-15;Il Etait Un Square
1;Tasty and a lot of fun;5.0;"On our first night in Paris, we wanted a place close to the hotel and a quick dinner. We came across this place and it was a very good choice. Hamburgers and other dishes are really good, but the best quality is the staff: nicest people in Paris! The owner treats you with a lot of care and ""from order to order"" plays some tunes on the piano (and very well!...musician's word). Also the waitress was very sweet. Felt like being at your friends' dinner party. Thank you!";mai-15;Il Etait Un Square
1;Amazing!!!;5.0;My wife and I just came back from a date night at Il était un square and we loved everything about it. A cosy restaurant at the 13th arrondissement with phenomenal burgers, delicious desserts and a very warm service. Nous allons certainement revenir avant la fin de notre séjour à Paris!!!;mai-15;Il Etait Un Square
1;Dinner by the park;5.0;Very friendly service, not a huge menu but they had some good twists on burger and tartare options. I really enjoyed my tartare with foie gras. Not many places in Paris where you can sit outside, listen to the birds and hardly any traffic;mai-15;Il Etait Un Square
1;Cancelled our reservation;1.0;What a place. You book ahead as we arrived late after a long trip to Paris. And then 2 hrs before the reservation the suddenly cancel the confirmed reservation No reason given. I wish the owners well with the bad news they must have received or with the restauration of the building as those would be the only valid reasons to do this.;mai-15;Il Etait Un Square
1;Steak tartare;5.0;Delicious lunch .The restaurant specialises in burger and tartare which was the attraction. We were delighted with the quality of the food and the service. The icing on the cake was to sit and eat outside in the sunshine .Very child friendly .most understanding about nut allergy.;avr-15;Il Etait Un Square
1;Fantastic burgers;5.0;We visited here in March after making a booking for our first night in Paris. I was relying on the trip advisor reviews and I am glad I did. The restaurant was small and the atmosphere was lovely with the owner playing on the piano. The food and wine were amazing. For a cheese plate, 2 main burger meals and a bottle of wine the price was somewhere around 50-60 euros which was great. This is somewhere I would definitely return to.;avr-15;Il Etait Un Square
1;Respect burger;5.0;Wow it's amazing and delicious burger. And it's my first time and I will repeated and I will visit il etait UN square many times.;avr-15;Il Etait Un Square
1;One of the best burgers in France!;5.0;The restaurant was a little hard to find, but it was really worth it. The burger we had was exceptional and the host was extremely service minded.;avr-15;Il Etait Un Square
1;Glad I tried it..;5.0;"I often go to Paris and I usually go to places that my friends recommend. This time however I checked trip advisor and came across ""il etait un square"". The place is cosy, the ambience is nice, Gerard and Nicholas are very friendly and helpful, and most of all the food is great!! I recommend the foie gras and magret de canard burger: ""L'hamburGERS"". Its very juicy and full of flavour.Will definitely go back!!";avr-15;Il Etait Un Square
1;A great Place with a warm reception from the owner!;5.0;If you're in Paris and want a break from some of the rich French cuisine and you're looking for some great home cooked burgers, look no further! This place was amazing, the food is great, the beers cold,and the tiramisu was also homemade and a house specialty to die for! So good. Very reasonably priced and the owner takes a lot of pride in his place. He's a great piano player and if time permits he plays some fantastic tunes! This is a must do if you're in Paris. Short metro ride from our hotel and about a 2 block walk from station! Hint, this metro line is only a few stops from the Eiffel Tower! The 6 line!;avr-15;Il Etait Un Square
1;Can't understand the ratings;2.0;We went to this restaurant relying on the tripadvisor rating, unfortunately we could not find the reputation in our plate. The fries were burned and the Burger had no special taste. The meat was not tasty at all. The owner seemed nice but could note stop telling about the great reputation his restaurant has online and how he reached his fame... and the place was almost empty.I do not recommend this place;avr-15;Il Etait Un Square
1;Amazing;5.0;Beautiful food in such a friendly and welcoming atmosphere. Fantastic find and would definitely recommend a visit!;avr-15;Il Etait Un Square
1;Hands-down amazing burgers and tartare;5.0;After seeing that this place ranked in the top ten of Paris restaurants we decided to try it. We were not disappointed. Incredible burgers, chips/fries, and beef tartare. I had the blue cheese burger and my partner had the gascon tartare which is seared. Flavours were beautiful and the meat tender and rich. Split a small starter and each had a pint and a half. Bill came to 60 euros. Owner served us and was very welcoming. A bit of the way but worth the trip. Highly recommended.;avr-15;Il Etait Un Square
1;Hidden Gem;5.0;Superb burgers in a very welcoming and friendly restaurant. The owner is extremely friendly and welcoming, the food incredibly fresh and well seasoned. I had the blue cheese burger and it was probably the best burger I've ever had. Cooked saignant, wonderfully juicy and tender. Puddings and starters were good but the burgers are the real show stopper.;mars-15;Il Etait Un Square
1;Very fine beef in the burger;4.0;This place is a little hidden but I f you are nearby go find it. A very fine home made burger with loads of soft runny cheddar. Good fries too. Wife was on the Cajun chicken burger. Home made chicken burger (real patty also homemade not breast) with spices. Good fries and not too expensive. Downside? I would have liked a spicy beef burger option alongside the spicy chicken and the choice of sides is limited. The bun was a bit unstable too even for an experienced burger wrangler like me. The service was good and the waiter very nice. Ignore the previous comment by the guy who had to wait for a bill, in France they linger after a meal. We were there for dinner but I imagine that lunch overlooking the park is lovely.;mars-15;Il Etait Un Square
1;Is it good? YES. Should it be on Top 5? NO;3.0;I was very curious about this place, so intrigued by the fact is was on the Top 5 restaurants in Paris that I decided to visit it. And here is what I found:I arrive earlier because I thought it would be full and I did not have a reservation. I mean, a restaurant in the Top 5 of TripAdvisor must be very popular. I was wrong, I was the first and only one. When I entered I noticed that the place is a burger joint with decent decoration, nothing outstanding but 2 pianos. The service is very good, the waiter speaks English and knows a few words in other languages. I found strange that the waiter was also the hostess, the bartender and the cashier. when I was the first one it was fine but later when there were other 5 tables, well... my bill took more than 15 minutes to arrive.I had a cheddar hamburger and it was good but nothing extraordinary as other reviews mention. I have eaten burgers in 11 countries and I am pretty sure this one ranks in the middle, good but average good. The burger included french fries, around 10% of them were completely burned. For dessert I had the creme brulee, which I did not like it that much, it was not very fresh and kind of dry. About the bar, the options are limited, specially wines, do not expect many bottles available. Overall, is a good place but definitely not outstanding, epic nor marvelous as so many people think.;mars-15;Il Etait Un Square
1;Won't forget and will come back!;5.0;We went in January for lunch and we were very happy with the food. The staff were very friendly and the atmosphere was very welcoming. We will def come back.;janv-15;Il Etait Un Square
1;wonderful;5.0;while visiting Paris attended this superb restaurant where nice burgers were served. will definetely comeback during our next tour in Paris;févr-15;Il Etait Un Square
1;Epic!!;5.0;After a short ride via taxi ride from our hotel we arrive at a short restaurant, we were nervous! It looked as if we had come to a friends for dinner! We really didn't need to be, the food was not only the best seasoned food i had tasted for a while, but the ingeredents were very fresh and cooked to perfection, they were very busy with a local newspaper in but service was not effected. A short summary, great food, brilliant service and a welcome break from the over priced average food and white tables of the champ!;janv-15;Il Etait Un Square
1;Not sure why this scores so highly!;1.0;Myself and a colleague visited there last night after reading some highly commendable reviews and were both bitterly disappointed. The food was not even average and left us both feeling really hungry and annoyed that we had wasted our money.It was really quiet as well, so perhaps expected more.I certainly wouldn't recommend this based on what we experienced and I don't often write reviews, so that's how disappointing it was.;janv-15;Il Etait Un Square
1;A gotta-go!;5.0;The second best burger I've Ever had. The Owner is one of the nicest people I,ve mer in Paris. He Even played the piano for us. Go there period;janv-15;Il Etait Un Square
1;Above and beyond;5.0;My wife and I visited this place while on vacation in Paris! Food was awesome!, But the service was spectacular!!. Both gentleman at the restaurant made us feel at home and when I accidentally dropped my beer, they rush and clean my mess and in no time I had a new beer on the house what a class act place. Should be number one on the list!;janv-15;Il Etait Un Square
1;A Must! Great Burger!;5.0;I'm from Texas and we have a plethora of great burger restaurants and quite frankly Ive yet to have a better burger outside of the State. However, Il Etait Un Square is the exception. Both my wife and I had the Le Cheddar burger and I have to say it was one of the best meals I had in Paris. They use a cheddar fondue cheese and drip it all over the patty. The grilled onions add exceptional flavor to the beef. I would suggest adding their mustard to the burger, it gives it a kick. Also, try the wine, the Cabernet Sauvignon is an excellent choice. We enjoyed it so much we went back for lunch.;janv-15;Il Etait Un Square
1;Great burger;5.0;If bored the beef fillet and want something else this is the place that you want.Great restaurant burgers.Is great experience to eat burger with a red wine glass...I remember my teen age....Yes i love it I will back again as soon as possibly.;nov-14;Il Etait Un Square
1;The place for a burger, good wine and warm welcome;5.0;Over the past two years, hamburgers have become a field of culinary experimentation in France. Chefs toyed with the wildest range of ingredients to invent their own hamburgers. Il était un square's own formula is the most successful among the many that I have tried. Keeping the number of ingredients at a reasonable minimum, the chef invented creative combinations and creamy, but not heavy, cheese sauces instead of the dull slice of industrial cheddar. Other, more traditional, dishes are on the menu. The list of wines has been carefully chosen.This is a welcoming, friendly and relaxed place which has faithful clientele. The atmosphere is great, and don't be surprised to hear live piano played by the owners themselves!;janv-15;Il Etait Un Square
1;You want a burger in Paris? This is the place.;5.0;Had a wonderful meal here with my Fiancé and baby boy, this is a lovely restaurant overlooking a square with a park to walk off the amount you will eat .Had a burger with sauce that was just melt in the mouth. Had great service from owner Gigi and Nicolas and will definitely be returning. Just go;déc-14;Il Etait Un Square
1;Just Amazing;5.0;We had a lovely lunch last week. The restaurant had a high chair which is a bonus as you can never find any. I had a perfect burger and fries to die for and so had my partner. We will def go back! The atmospher was perfect and price too.;déc-14;Il Etait Un Square
1;food for thought;5.0;"This is a very good value for money restaurant. We had lunch twice, no dinner. The place was crowded (mainly people working for ""Le Monde""), but the staff remained very friendly and helpful. The food is genuine and tasty. Good tartare and pasta! Lots of wine by the glass that are worthwhile tasting. Free wifi available.";déc-14;Il Etait Un Square
1;Nice spot for a meal and some wine;4.0;I was too chicken to try the tartare but my burger was a delicious take on what could have been a boring order. Instead it was cooked to order with blue cheese, nuts, and some amazing kind of bacon. Add to that a very nice red wine and tasty creme brûlée. A very satisfying meal and good service at a fair (for Paris) price. Exactly what I was looking for. Plus no 'tourist menu' in English... just a patient waiter with a good grasp of frenglish.;nov-14;Il Etait Un Square
1;A neighborhood gem!;5.0;We found this restaurant in an effort to get to know the Buttes aux Cailles neighborhood better. And it was a great find! The restaurant is known for unique burgers and tartars. The food is delicious, the pichets of wine are very well chosen, and the server really enjoys his job. The tiramisu was amazing!;oct-14;Il Etait Un Square
1;Neighbourhood café and restaurant;4.0;"This very cosy, local café opposite of the parc (""square"") René Le Gall, is one of our favorite places in Paris. The staff is very friendly. The owner is an unusual sort, Napoleon and classical musi admirer. Expect him or others playing on the e-piano next to the bar, or playing a Beethoven CD.There is usually a local crowd of nice people. The staff is child-friendly, although we are still waiting for the promised acquisition of a high chair.The kitchen style recently changed, they now specialise on tartar and burgers, including one veggie. Some salads are available as well. The burgers are very decent, and offer a rather wide selection of interesting combinations of ingredients.Café Gourmand is just so-so, one of the three deserts is a serving of whipped cream (chantilly).Prices for food are pretty good for the quality you get. Coffee is a bit expensive for this area.";mai-14;Il Etait Un Square
2;Great address;5.0;"We tried the Boutary experience for our wedding anniversary, and it's just been the perfect place for that : great service (they had a nice nod to our anniversary, much appreciated) , amazing food with a great deal of work in your plate (besides the caviar tasting which I also recommend), perfect wine pairing... and to be honest, a very fair price/quality ratio ! All in one a great evening.We heard of a sister restaurant ""Petit Boutary"" which we now definitely want to check sometime soon";sept-20;Boutary
2;Outstanding cuisine and service, one of a kind.;5.0;Highly recommend for any culinary amateur and professionals, the house has very high standards that made our visit amazingly memorable.Frederic was very knowledgable about the wine selection, the plates explanation and of course the house's caviar selection - how they differ from one another, different taste preferences across countries and so on.Maxime's cuisine is exceptional. The techniques and mixes of flavours was very refined and diverse. Very friendly too, he always comes in the room to present one of the dishes.;sept-20;Boutary
2;Romantic fine dining at its best;5.0;My fiancée and me went here for our engagement anniversary and it was definitely the right choice. The interior of the restaurant is very cozy, especially the top floor with very few tables. The unobtrusive music makes it even better. There is no a la carte, only the tasting menu. We went for the 7-course tasting with premium wine selection and every course was amazing. It started with seafood but even my fiancée who is not a fan of it really liked it. The level of finesse was through the roof. The service was very professional but friendly at the same time. The waiter really took time to explain everything and he had a lot of knowledge. Every wine offered was excellent. They have a great selection of vodkas and really nice caviar too. This place is not cheap but worth every euro. They should have a Michelin star.;sept-20;Boutary
2;Beautiful experience;5.0;Only a small restaurant but the food and ambience was 1st class, so much I rate this Michelin star restaurant without the Michelin prices;nov-19;Boutary
2;We tried 5 course menu and;5.0;We tried 5 course menu and wine match + Caviar experience for my birthday dinner. I understand why this restaurant is number 1 in Paris’s fine dining. It was exceptional and we had really great time. This should be must place to try if you are in Paris.;août-20;Boutary
2;Fabulous;5.0;This restaurant is absolutely fabulous. We had the 7 course tasting menu and every dish excuisit. Some I never tried before. Ok, it is very expensive, but for a treat it is well worth the money. Great service too. I hope to go back again.;août-20;Boutary
2;Amazing experience!;5.0;What can I say: I was looking for one good restaurant to treat ourselves during our weekend in Paris. We've chosen 7 course tasting menu with wine pairing and each course as well as paired wine was just delicious. I truly believe that how you like the food really depends on your taste/liking. The experience, however, not- it was just great. Servers were attentive and knowledgable, each course and wine was explained. Restaurant ambiance was amazing too. Even the candles in the bathroom stole my heart! Would come back.;juil-20;Boutary
2;Delicious diner with a 5 * service;5.0;I had an amazing and unforgettable dinner at Boutary rue Mazarine. In the heart of quartier latin in Paris ... we were proposed to start with a coupe of Billecart Salmon. The following was just better and better. A fresh tuna with flower seasonning and passion fruit vinaigrette... Porcini mushroom & lobster with red berrie-sauce ( unforgettable!) . Then turbot with beetroot salt and artichoke ( my favorite !). Thank you Maxime for your creativity and precision ! All of this amazing dishes served with the perfect wine-pairing . A special thanks to the manager Frédéric who had a big smile ...we could see it thought the mask. The restaurant respects all the consignes for the actual Situation. Cherry on the cake at the end with the chocolat cake with cherry by the cheffe-pâtissière Yuko. I am not ready to forget The litchee ice cream in the end . Looking forward to taste it again soon. Thanks Boutary for amazing gastronomie experience.Leticia;juil-20;Boutary
2;Absolutely heavenly!!! The;5.0;Absolutely heavenly!!! The chef is a true artist. Enjoined Every course. The intimite atmosphere of the restaurant adds to the intens enjoyable rich flavours of the meal. The accompanying wines where perfectly matched.;juil-20;Boutary
2;Amazing caviar;5.0;We were invited to this restaurant, very nice decoration, we tasted caviar, I had already eaten it but here it was really delicious, the staff was professional and very chic, a wonderful memory;déc-19;Boutary
2;Fabulous Anniversary Dinner!;4.0;We had a wonderful anniversary dinner here. The tasting menu was fabulous, the caviar was exceptional, and we loved the French wine pairing. The staff made the experience extra special.;mars-20;Boutary
2;absolute pleasure to eat at this restaurant;5.0;We liked everything about the place, the intimacy of the interior, the friendliness of the staff and above all, the quality of the food, a real pleasure for the senses!;mars-20;Boutary
2;excellent;5.0;"Caviar is the specialty in the boutary. My husband and I had the 5 course meal and one of the starters was the caviar on mashed potatoes. Very fine, very aromatic, with a great sauce. The second starter, a puree of oyster, cod, grilled leek, with smoked sheep's cheese foam in a leek soup, was extraordinarily harmonious and fine. The main course was a small strip of dry-aged beef with fine jus and a ""noodle nest"" made from celery. Everything beautifully arranged and perfectly decorated. The wine selection was fantastic.The service was perfect and very personal according to the level of the restaurant.";mars-20;Boutary
2;Amazing;5.0;We had an amazing dinner! The caviar was incredible and so were our meals. I can not wait to go back!;févr-20;Boutary
2;Delicious and excellent service;5.0;Great experience, decoration is amazing, the food spectacular, you have to try the Caviar Tasting Menu where they let you try all different types of caviar, a real eye opener. The location is very convenient. It is pricey, but worth it.;déc-19;Boutary
2;Nice surprise;5.0;We went here because we were late to book some other restaurants while staying in Paris. So we did not expect much. But then we got all and even more. Small place with just the right decor and really excellent staff. We did not go for the caviar tasting menu that is a signature of this restaurant but got caviar with the second entree. Very good. But also all other dishes from the tasting menu were lovely balanced in taste and imaginative as well.;févr-20;Boutary
2;Not to be missed in Paris;5.0;Amazing dining experience - innovating cuisine (we had tasting menu and more and each dish was impeccable and interesting - chef Maxime is creative (still thinking about puffed buckwheat in one dish), outstanding customer service (Frederick is a star in this restaurant, though, every team member was great and genuinely welcoming and caring). Boutary has of the best caviars we have tried, better than many top brands and was also well priced to be added to the dining experience, so definitely go for it, you will not be disappointed! Champagne and wine pairing was perfect and vodka tasting was also very interesting. We would say restaurant delivers on every level, my only comment would be if you want a more romantic atmosphere, request inner dining room (they have upstairs, but we have not seen it).;févr-20;Boutary
2;Excellent!;5.0;This place is a gem! Must try the wine pairings, it is an out right luxury.The service is off the charts and I can not rave enough about the foods.;nov-19;Boutary
2;We had à splendid evening;5.0;We had a wonderful evening here. Food is delicious, staff is very welcoming and friendly, great atmosphere. Top!!!;févr-20;Boutary
2;A Little Gem;5.0;My husband and I visited Boutary for dinner as we were staying nearby and it had received excellent reviews on-line. It was a fantastic evening. Firstly, the staff were totally engaged, 100% professional and obviously all had a passion for both the food and wine the restaurant provided and a huge pride in their work and the restaurant. Secondly the food was superb. We went for the five course surprise tasting menu which they amended as I don't like oysters but my husband does. Each of the courses was a little explosion of flavours and textures and also a pleasure to the eye. We opted for the three glasses of wine to go with the food and they were perfectly paired.Thirdly, despite having the five courses and various amuse-bouches to start, we were served exactly the right amount of food to fill us up so we left replete but not overfed!The whole experience was a real treat and I would highly recommend it.;févr-20;Boutary
2;One of the best meals in Paris!;5.0;This restaurant had amazing food and outstanding staff. The flavor and texture of each dish was melt in your mouth and the waiters were personable and incredibly kind. We were not disappointed and extremely grateful we made the decision to eat there. Go with the tasting menu for both food and wine if you can afford and you will leave more satisfied then ever! Frederic was a doll!!;févr-20;Boutary
2;7 course tasting menu is everything;5.0;7 course tasting menu is everything and more! A must in Paris, went for a short weekend break and having the tasting course let me feel as if I’d been all round Paris tasting french cuisine! Absolutely gorgeous place - definitely recommend! The staff are all wonderful!;févr-20;Boutary
2;Simply perfect;5.0;My wife was really impressed by the professionalism of the staff and the food! I had the noix de saint Jacques with caviar, these guys know what they doing. At the second you get in the restaurant you feel in an another world!!! She had the black truffle risotto. Interesting experience will definitely come back. We just felt like our waiter was not happy being there which is a bit unfortunate for a place like this.The customers shouldn’t feel that. Overall our experience was amazing.;déc-19;Boutary
2;Pretty good;4.0;Service was knowledgeable and friendly. Food was pretty good but portions are small. I left still hungry.;janv-20;Boutary
2;Perfect;5.0;We had the news years menue and it was. Especially the caviar and the blue lobster was delicious. Wine pairing was also great an a perfect match. We will come back during our next Paris visit!;janv-20;Boutary
2;Thanks to Frederic for a very special and fun evening!;5.0;From the moment we arrived, the team at Boutary welcomed us with open arms. Frederic and his team showed us to the back of the warm and bijou restaurant where our table was waiting within a room of funky striped lighting in the walls and ceiling. The decor is ‘cool’ and there is very soft music playing (Depeche Mode) in the ambience. The cutlery is modern and stylish! Throughout the dinner experience the food was colourful, delicious and full of flavour. The wine was quaffable and accompanied the gorgeous fish dishes (scallops and sea-bass) perfectly. Dessert was the highlight for us...pineapple with clementine...absolutely LUSH! Frederic, whom was very smartly attired went out of his way to make our evening very special. His charming and polite conversation accompanied by his super chat, recommendations for afterwards (great bar called Prescription, next door and Alcazar, opposite) were perfect. He’s a talented gentleman whom has travelled the world and worked in Japan and Vietnam...to name a few. It’s worth engaging in conversation to hear of his adventures. Boutary is a VERY lovely dining experience where service is focussed on without stuffiness or aloofness. The team have smiles, talk to you, offer advice and guidance...they want to help and for you to have a great time. The price of the 3 courses with wine was aligned to a dinner for a special occasion. A definite positive recommendation from me for your fabulous evening in Paris. Thanks very much to Frederic and his team. Merci beaucoup and Arigato!;janv-20;Boutary
2;Very goooooood;5.0;Food excellent, wine selection is perfect. If u cannot chose desert - take both)) In any way this place is “must have”;janv-20;Boutary
2;Beyond expectations;5.0;Booked here because the reviews have been good. Our dinner experience was beyond expectations. Exquisite food with surprises, beautifully presented, right size portions all contributed to a memorable experience. Service was super friendly, knowledgeable and impressively international - different languages were spoken to customers. Well worth a visit. I hope they continue to be successful.;janv-20;Boutary
2;Wonderful experience;5.0;It has been a wonderful experience: we chose the 5 course menu + caviar + premium wines: simply perfect! The waiter provided us an excellent service, with clear and passionate explanations. Dishes were a taste explosion and supremely presented. Price is high, but it’s 100% worth.;janv-20;Boutary
2;Rightfully one of the best Paris restaurant;5.0;Room is not clogged with tables, you will have your personal space. We visited Boutary for lunch and it was an excellent experience. (Check pics AngeloB971), buttersquash soup with lobster ravioli, caviar from their own Bulgarian farm, wild seabass, roasted duck leg with black garlic (in house made), desserts 2 to choose from. tangerine or chocolate, either way you can not miss. Very plesant and professional staff, moderate prices. Worth to visit while in Paris, dinner time reservation is a must.;janv-20;Boutary
2;Third annual visit as wonderful as the first No, better!;5.0;We love Boutary. This was our third visit. for the past 3 years we have celebrated our anniversary there. We had the 7-course tasting menu and matching premium wines. The food is wonderful and the chef very creative. The atmosphere is elegant but not stuffy. Frederic the host is a very sincere and friendly person. we love seeing him and hope to continue to return whenever we visit Paris.;déc-19;Boutary
2;A wonderful evening;5.0;We had one night in Paris and were so delighted that we chose to dine at Boutary. The food was amazing, the wine pairing was perfect, the ambiance was relaxed. It was a night that my husband and I will remember for years tocome. The whole experience was fantastic. I would highly highly recommend going. We had the 5 course menu with wine pairing.;déc-19;Boutary
2;Upscale 5 course meal;5.0;Boutary is located in a trendy part of Paris on a street lined with art galleries and pubs. The facade of the restaurant is subtle but when u walk in u r transported to a contemporary environment. This evenings menu was a choice between a 5 or 7 course tasting. Both are reasonably priced ($89 euros for the 5 course). Food was decadent and the artsy presentations amazing. If u want to try a fancy inventive menu fo here and not Jules Verne. The difference in price alone is worth trying Boutery. Besides, you could be a trend setter yourself and not just a follower.Go and enjoy the Boutary.;déc-19;Boutary
2;Lovely experience, delicious food;5.0;We booed after reading the good reviews on TripAdvisor. We weren’t disappointed. The place is a bit old fashioned. The main place is not too big but it has additional space at the back and maybe upstairs. The gentleman who served us was very kind. He spoke with us from time to time and made us feel welcome. We took the tasting menu, which was excellent. We needed some adjustments with the food, which wasn’t a problem. The food and deserts were delicious. Together with a very nice bottle of Burgundy, we paid 240 Euros for two people. We will return!;déc-19;Boutary
2;An underrated jewel of a gourmet restaurant in Paris;5.0;This is a great little restaurant with a specialty in caviar. It has always been high class cooking, and with the new chef Maxime Lesobre a star is justified: Very delicate combinations of taste, texture and temperature that play with your taste buds - the way to happiness has never been so easy to reach: Take the 5 course menue and the wine pairing and let Frederic take care of you. One of the best restaurants in Paris.;déc-19;Boutary
2;Impeccable evening;5.0;Outstanding service, food, ambience and all round experience. This was the favourite part of our trip and we will undoubtably be back. The staff were incredibly knowledgable and accommodating, it wasn’t just dinner, it was an education in french cuisine.;déc-19;Boutary
2;Do Not Miss Dining Here!;5.0;One of the best dining experiences we had on this visit to Paris. We were never sure who was our waiter as we had several different people accommodating us from seating to different dish presentations, etc. and found everyone to be so very pleasant. We had the 5-course dinner and each dish was aesthetic prepared with outstanding flavors and textures. At times, tasting menu dining can be a bit stuffy as was our experience the next night at a Michelin-star restaurant but at Boutary, they have accomplished both the food sophistication of an Michelin restaurant in a cheerful and comfortable ambience.;déc-19;Boutary
2;My wife and I and 9 year old;5.0;My wife and I and 9 year old son had a great 7 course meal there. They were very hospitable, knowledgeable and friendly to our son. Plan on taking your time to enjoy a long meal. Well worth it, highly recommend. Chef came out at the end and asked us all what we thought. First class service.;déc-19;Boutary
2;Wauuu caviar and fois gras-champagne;5.0;Wauuu caviar and fois gras what is not to like - the waiter took alot if time explaining about the beluga All Wines pefectly chosen for the dishes;déc-19;Boutary
2;The Food and Wine are Better than Fine!;5.0;Bringing a group of 9 from the U.S. to Paris was no easy task. Finding a great restaurant that had the space for our size and was open on a Saturday - even harder to find. I found a review by Michelin that had flattering things to say about Boutary. They were located a walk away from the hotel where we were staying. After being turned down by 3 other restaurants, I wearily sent a request for a reservation. Viola! They responded promptly, with a yes. And boy, were we glad they did.The restaurant is designed sparse, but lovely. We were escorted to the second floor, which had ample space for us! Our host for the evening could not have been nicer and more helpful. The fact he spoke such good English was an asset for those in our group who were not fluent in french. We had the 5 course tasting menu with wine pairings. I can't recall the last time I was out to dinners and heard so many approving moans of satisfaction!We started with a cavier sampling - Wow - how much fun and so delicious. The first course, a consume with fresh mushrooms and a red fish was exquisite. But even better was the wine we were served. Everyone (even the most discerning in our group) were taking pictures of the label, in hopes of finding a bottle (or two) to bring home. Each subsequent course continued to pleasantly surprise us, until the finale - the desert. I wish I had a picture to share. It was gorgeous and tasted as good as it looked. My unruly group offered a standing ovation to the chef and sous chef at the end of our meal! This was a most memorable way to end our incredible trip to Paris.Do not miss a visit here the next time you are in Paris!Bon Apetit;déc-19;Boutary
2;Tasting menu done well;5.0;Finally, a tasting menu we actually enjoyed. It was overpriced. It was a fair high price for quality food. The atmosphere was very relaxed, quite the opposite from other tasting menu restaurants we’ve been to. Five stars.;déc-19;Boutary
2;Affordable & delicious tasting menu;5.0;I was really impressed with the service and food we had at Boutary. We opted for the tasting menu with wine pairing and started off with some caviar. This being a caviar house it was a must and we didn't regret it. Every dish was excellent and exciting. I particularly loved the seaweed butter mash with caviar. The staff were very attentive and the young chef even came out to introduce himself after service. A truly unique and unforgettable evening!;déc-19;Boutary
2;Best food I have EVER tasted;5.0;The food is fantastic, and the waiters are so good at explaining the ingredients, cooking techniques, and the taste sensations. The best food Ive EVER tasted, also the most Ive ever paid for a meal, but so so worth it ! We chose the 'taster' menu and the variations are superb, and wines to go with them.;déc-19;Boutary
2;A meal for all the senses.;5.0;Boutary is a beautiful restaurant with professional and attentive service. The food is a treat for the palate and artistically presented. We had a romantic and delicious meal with the tasting menu. While a more expensive meal than some, still a comfortable atmosphere. Boutary is a real treat and worth it!;nov-19;Boutary
2;Absolutely excellent.;5.0;"This place is delicious and chic. We had had caviar once or twice before but didn't really ""get"" it. Their beluga caviar was delicious. Even if you skip the caviar, the entire meal was outstanding.";nov-19;Boutary
2;It’s not only the caviars...;5.0;It’s not only the caviars, but the staff and the entire rest of the menu makes the place special. A definite one visit in Paris.;nov-19;Boutary
2;Excellent meal and wine;5.0;We had the seven course taster menu pair with the wine. I thoroughly enjoyed every dish and the staff were attentive, friendly and helpful.;nov-19;Boutary
2;Everything was perfect!;5.0;Delicious dishes and kind serving from the first and the last. We had very tasty and satisfied time. We had lunch but better to have dinner.;nov-19;Boutary
2;Fantastic;5.0;Cute restaurant and delicious food! I am a picky eater and my friend called ahead to see if there was anything I would be able to eat and they were SO accommodating!! I got a pork dish and it was to die for! Highly recommend.;mai-19;Boutary
2;Holiday visit to Paris;5.0;Amazing food and great service!!  Highly recommend to anyone. Would definitely come back again for sure.;nov-19;Boutary
2;Fantastic experience!;5.0;We ate here as a special treat on our honeymoon and were very impressed with the ambience, the food and especially the service.We didn't eat from the tasting menu instead selecting our own starters, mains and desserts from the a la carte options. The dishes from the tasting which we saw come out to other tables all sounded good but we were more than happy with our plates (langoustine - divine! scallops - amazing! dry aged beef - stupendous! you get the idea....)We didn't purposely avoid the caviar but it didn't fit with our choices this time.It feels like it must be hard to stand out in a crowded fine dining market such as Paris but I think Boutary has got the formula just right. You need to go!;nov-19;Boutary
2;Very good!;5.0;Everything was wonderful. The service was fabulous and informative, the restaurant was cozy and easy to find. The food was absolutely delicious, as were the wine pairings. An absolutely lovely surprise to find this restaurant and discover a memorable meal. Highly recommend!;nov-19;Boutary
2;Fabulous;5.0;During our six weeks in France we ate at around 75 different restaurants, this was one of our favorites. The service was excellent and the food was outstanding. Highly recommend this restaurant.;oct-19;Boutary
2;Indulgence at its best !;5.0;There are two or maybe three very obvious critical success factors for an excellent restaurant:1. Excellent food2. Excellent service 3. Pleasant surroundings/atmosphereAnd I am very pleased to say that the Boutary excels in both the food and service in what can be described as a warm and cosy surrounding. In fact, it has been quite some time since I have experienced such a high standard of service coupled with a an exceptional good meal.Caviar is obviously well represented on the menu and if you like caviar, I can certainly recommend it as you will not be disappointed. The caviar is exceptional as either a taster or within the menu where it is an integral part of the meal.For those that enjoy caviar, you will appreciate the difference between what is typically a more production style caviar to something that is far more refined and as such far more pleasurable for the pallet. While the restaurant is not inexpensive for Paris, the price is certainly in line with both the exceptional food and service - well done ! Would I return ? Can't wait !;oct-19;Boutary
2;We will be back;4.0;Great service, excellent wines and fantastic food. We loved the tuna carpacio and the chocolate cake. Really highly recommended.;oct-19;Boutary
2;It’s the best!;5.0;We were not in a good mood when we arrived due to bad weather. It’s a nice cosy restaurant and we expected something ordinary only. But no! It’s so good that we got totally cheered up and satisfied!We had the beluga caviar, langoustines, pomme de terre, wild sole, lamb, and dessert. All were delicious. The 2 main dishes were actually divine, and were better than the main dishes we had in the several Michelin starred restaurants during the same trip. We sent our compliments to the chef who went out to meet and thank us. And special thanks to the top waiter. He lights up the room with his warm attitude. And he is fluent in 5 languages, wow!;oct-19;Boutary
2;The best in Paris;5.0;Perfect food and impeccable service in a relaxed setting. The best meal we’ve had in Paris and exceptional value.;nov-19;Boutary
2;Five stars!;5.0;There's a reason this restaurant is in the top 10 in Paris, it does not disappoint and at the same time is not pretentious or over the top expensive. We went for one of the set courses with a premium wine pairing and each course was an experience in itself. Some courses were brilliant in their simplicity (e.g. a creamy potato dish with Kaviar) and others very complex, but everything was well-balanced and we couldnt decide on a favourite dish. The staff were welcoming, very chatty and took joy in explaining the food and wine and talking about Paris and French cuisine. Can't wait to go back!;juil-19;Boutary
2;BEAUTIFUL EXPERIENCE;5.0;What a fun experience.,, Wonderful beautiful food, with an exquisite presentation and fabulous service. Certainly not something I could afford to do on a regular basis, but very appropriate for our only visit to Paris. Certainly a culinary delight I felt they could have been a little more generous with wine for the amount of money we spent,,,but otherwise perfection;oct-19;Boutary
2;oohlala;5.0;Dining at the Boutary was a gastronomic delight! The service was impeccable, the presentation of the dishes was picture perfect and the food was delicious. A must experience in Paris!;oct-19;Boutary
2;Romantic & Intimate French Restaurant with Great Caviar & Champagne;5.0;We visited the restaurant for my wife's birthday celebration. We searched through TripAdvisor and found this place to fit all of our criteria for a special night. And we're not disappointed. The Sturgeon caviar is incredible, so refined and tasty either by itself or part of the magic dish created by the chef. The waiter is very friendly and knowledgeable, helped us understand and appreciate and enjoy more of the rare morsel. We ordered the five-course fix price meal, and we truly believe it's the best deal compared to order ala cart. Each course is amazing, a feast to the senses, sight and taste buds. Truly a masterpiece and unforgettable experience.Merci Beaucoup!;oct-19;Boutary
2;Superb;5.0;Everything is wonderful here. Second visit for us, even bigger group. Everyone loved it. See you next year :);oct-19;Boutary

2;1st Class in every respect;5.0;We enjoyed the five course Chef’s dinner which opened with Beluga Caviar and concluded with a wonderful Chocolate desert.Excellent wine list and friendly staff.Put Boutary at the top of your Paris restaurant list.?;oct-19;Boutary
2;Just Perfect;5.0;A very nice setting, an extremely friendly staff, delicious food, excellent wine we had a perfect evening for my wife’s 45 Birthday;oct-19;Boutary
2;Cute!;4.0;As fine dining goes, this was an experience on its own. My husband and I did the 7 course, but if you’re going to do a course I’d recommend just going with a 5 course. I didn’t love their chicken dish- tasted weird to me, but my husband liked it. The restaurant doesn’t have much decoration, but makes up for it with their food! We had the 3 wine course that goes with your food and you can definitely tell the difference in the taste of food with the wine pairing. Loved the experience, don’t think I’d go back thought if I went back to Paris. It was a wonderful one time experience.;oct-19;Boutary
2;Wonderful anniversary dinner;5.0;"My wife and I spent a week in Paris for our tenth anniversary. We booked a table at Boutary for the last night of our trip. Fantastic, attentive, English-friendly service. We selected the five course tasting menu and the standard wine pair, along with the beluga caviar and champagne to start. Recommend the caviar to all those who haven't had it. Was an experience, and the staff explained it all to us very well. Food was excellent overall. First plate was an unbelievable roast fig with blue cheese and a nut topping. Out of this world. Second plate was a smoked potato mousse with caviar and a cheese cracker. Really good. caviar very different from the beluga starter. Third plate was monkfish tail. Not a huge fan of monkfish, but it was done about as well as it could have been. Fourth plate was a chicken dish. Last dish was a dense chocolate cake. Also great. While the food was very good, it was the service and the feel that made it special. Many thanks to the crew there!Our one complaint had nothing to do with the staff or the restaurant itself. About 20 minutes after we sat down a pack, and I mean a pack, of thirty to forty year old American (I think they were American. they at least spend time here in the states because they referenced Florida several times) women sat down. There were eight of them. Loud as hell, obnoxious, totally unaware of their surroundings (three other relatively quiet couples in a room that held only about 20 people total). The first thing they yelled at the staff was ""BRING THE WINE!!!"". Unbelievable. Then they went on to shop for really expensive handbags, facetime with their kids, reference the fact that this was their sixth girls night this month, and on and on. All three other tables were bewildered, and these women were not that nice to the staff. Did not want to hear about the story of the food, made all kinds of substitutions, and the list goes on. And my wife and I are 36 and spent a good amount of the trip partying. We aren't shut ins. If we were put off, speaks to how bad it was. To all who go to restaurants of this quality, do your neighbors a favor and be aware of your surroundings. The folks at Boutary, and the fellow customers, deserved more.";sept-19;Boutary

2;Go for the 5 course degustation;5.0;This is a gem. Great service. You don’t get to choose if you do the tasting menu, but they won’t disappoint.;sept-19;Boutary
2;Best dinner in Paris!;5.0;Read reviews before making a reservation and was rewarded with a dinner beyond our expectations! The waitstaff's service was exceptional (the chef and then the owner served us at our table), the presentation perfect and the food heavenly delicious. If there is only one resturant to eat at in Paris this is the one!!!;sept-19;Boutary
2;Looooove Caviar;5.0;The place is wonderful! Decoration is amazing, the food spectacular, you have to try the Caviar Tasting Menu where they let you try all different types of caviar, a real eye opener. The atmosphere is great and it's definitely a fantastic restaurant to go for a date!;nov-18;Boutary
2;Started well but ultimately disappointing;3.0;We booked Boutary based on the amazing trip advisor reviews encouraged by the 1 star Michelin rating. The restaurant is cute, romantic, and the service upon our welcome was great. So were the amuse bouche and starters as part of the tasting menu. The smoked potato with caviar dish was a highlight but after this we were both disappointed by the main courses. They weren’t bad but just ok and both of us felt a little bland which is not what you expect for the price and accolades. The fish was well cooked but not distinctive and there were 3-4 flavours used to accompany that seemed a bit random and confused. The tiny strip of beef which followed was tough and again presented with a slightly confusing array of sauces that didn’t enhance the dish. I did mention the beef being tough to the waiter when he took the plate and he said he would feed back to the chef..Finally as someone who loves wine I was disappointed by the quality of the wines poured for the premium pairing. Not a big point because wine taste is subjective but didn’t feel the wines matched the price.;sept-19;Boutary
2;Personable Michelin experience;5.0;Great food experience, my wife and i celebrated our anniversary here and couldn’t ask for a better meal. Hey the service was spot on and the door was fantastic. Busy try the beluga caviar!;sept-19;Boutary
2;Delightful!!;5.0;If you have just one night in Paris... Boutary is the place to go!Food is delicious, every dish is a surprise full of flavours, Michelin quality food for a fraction of the price.Service is impeccable yet very friendly and quite informal.I would definitely recommend and I would love to come back!;sept-19;Boutary
2;Super experience !;5.0;Fantastic experience in a cosy restaurant.  Service and food much above average.  Small delicious portions decorated like pieces of art.;sept-19;Boutary
2;Not to be missed;5.0;The food was fantastic and the service was excellent. We opted for the tasting menu and one guest did not eat fish but they made adjustments with no fuss. It was also one of the guests birthdays and they brought out a candle and some macaroons. It has a nice relaxed dinning experience and is good value for money.;sept-19;Boutary
2;Almost the best;4.0;Reading about this restaurant made me wanted to dine there , therefore we decided to go . A cheerful welcome was already a good sign . They seated us upstairs where we appreciated the decor all done around black red and white with an interesting illumination. The menu offers different choices from a degustation menu that involves also different wines from menu a la carte . We decided for a la carte and a bottle of Sancerre 2016 . But first We could not renounce to the temptation of tasting some beluga caviar which was excellent . The wine was excellent although it never reached the perfect temperature . My first course was bonito in tataki sauce which was delicious except for the chipped dish in which it was served . As a main course I choose a turbot with artichokes cooked in 3 ways, clams and a symphony of tastes that were exquisite . We were extremely pleased also with the perfect service and by meeting the creative chef .A place worth to return .;sept-19;Boutary
2;Excellent food and great atmosphere;5.0;Me and my wife went to this restaurant for a dinner during our 4 days stay at Paris.The restaurant is small but very cozy and has great atmosphere inside.We had a tasting menu together with selection of premium paired wine. The food was very delicious as well as the wine. The prices are high, but its totally worth it. The staff are very polite and friendly! We would definitely recommend this restaurant for a special occasion or for a romantic evening.;août-19;Boutary
2;Amazing;4.0;We ate here last summer and it was amazing! They have alot of caviar. Our first dish with some kind of potato was delisious!;oct-18;Boutary

We visited for our anniversary and did the set menu with caviar and wine pairings. Every item that came out was described in detail and everything was perfect. We absolutely loved this restaurant and highly recommend it.;mai-19;Boutary
2;Amazing food;5.0;Lovely place with superb food. Went as a special birthday treat. Had the tasting menu and each dish was perfect. The caviar was amazing and so was the strawberry and basil desert. Great service, cosy place and excellent food.;août-19;Boutary

2;what a pleasure;4.0;Very good menu & food.The service was friendly. The location is very convenient. It is pricey, but worth it.Its a memory on our travels we will never forget;juin-19;Boutary
2;Refined menu filled w/ beautiful flavour profiles;5.0;What a gorgeous restaurant. The interior is chic but cost at the same time. Had the set lunch menu (amazing value), both dishes were fish. I didn’t quite expect to be blown away but I was completely! The lightness of both dishes was just beautiful. So many subtle flavors that came together in harmony on the plate. Perfect balance of textures. Service was also not to be forgotten! What a way to end my last day in Paris. Highly recommend for lunch!!!;août-19;Boutary
2;Fantastic food, trust all the comments here and book right now!;5.0;Went to Boutary on my last day in Paris. It was great. The service was excellent. The food was definitely one of the best meals I have ever had. The dessert is so great, not like typical french level of sweetness, it’s very mild. Thought the green filling was pistachio, but it was basil flavour! It was a genius invention! The combination of the taste is beyond description.;juil-19;Boutary
2;Out of this World!;5.0;Sometimes you go to a restaurant and at the end of it, you know that it will be a memory for a lifetime. The atmosphere, decor and service were perfect. it's modern and fresh but also intimate. The food and the menu is fantastic and every course was a delight. The staff were extremely helpful and very amiable. They made a simple mistake during the serving which we pointed out and they corrected it immediately, apologised and served us a complimentary drink. Everything about the evening was perfect and I can't wait to go back!;mai-19;Boutary
2;Great cozy atmosphere and stellar service;5.0;Had a great dinner here with Charles and team. The caviar piece was a bit of a surprise but thoroughly enjoyed. We were able to learn more about different types of caviar and Charles took a lot of time explaining all the details. Servers all worked as a well oiled team. Great experience overall!;juil-19;Boutary
2;Magnifique!;5.0;Wonderful restaurant and staff in the heart of Paris. This was our first visit and we will be sure to go back. The menu selections were plentiful and varied, the wine list fantastic and the cuisine was fresh, thoughtful and beautifully presented. A treat for sure!;juil-19;Boutary
2;and so much more than just the caviar...;5.0;The level of execution is very high. Dishes are subtle, yet packed with flavor. The caviar is, unexpectedly, luxurious and harmonious accompaniment to the menu, rather than the star. An exceptional experience.;juil-19;Boutary
2;Ooh La La!!!;5.0;What a treat! Enjoyed this intimate restaurant for their lunch menu of the day. Do not miss the Pommes de Terre with caviar - it's their signature dish and sooooo good! The snickers sorbet was pretty amazing too! Great service and wine suggestion.;juil-19;Boutary
2;Very relaxed evening;5.0;Superb meal from a short menu with a well chosen wine list and excellent service.The staff are very knowledgeable, and the food well sourced. But it comes at a price as always!;juil-19;Boutary
2;Boutary - Excellent food and customer service;5.0;Delicious food, excellent customer service and wait staff, Would go back right away! We enjoyed the chef's special dinner selection and it included caviar and a delicious dessert. We had many servings of vegetables, meat and side items.;juil-19;Boutary
2;Creativity in cuisine;5.0;Unusual flavors and ingredients get to know each other in tempting carousels of dishes.We did the tasting menu. Replete with caviar, tuna, turbot, pigeon, and that's just the start.The server was very helpful with wine pairings. Pacing of service was relaxed.At the same time, the food was playful and inspiring. Cooking and saucing to perfection.Wide ranging wine selections as well as some house varietals. Caution: one end of Mazarine is closed to traffic. Best to approach from the South.;juil-19;Boutary
2;Great dinner with my wife;5.0;I absolutely recommend this restaurant for a fantastic meal experience in Paris. The food was excellent and the caviar tasting was top notch.;juil-19;Boutary
2;An absolute delight;4.0;By far the best seafood I have had anywhere and the service was even better. Looking to come back sooner rather than later.;juin-19;Boutary
2;Highly recommend!;5.0;The food was delicious and the service impeccable!  The waitstaff was very friendly and knowledgeable about caviar.  Wonderful experience!;juil-19;Boutary
2;What a lucky find!;5.0;We had planned a few dinners in advance of our trip, but found Boutary while we were already in Paris. The menu (and the photos on the web site) looked fantastic, so we reserved a table. We weren't disappointed - the service and food were impeccable and we were happy to meet the chef. They pay special attention to caviar and do an excellent job explaining the differences in more and less-aged caviar, for example, and what to look for in taste and texture when sampling it.The wine list was fantastic and I enjoyed talking about Rhone producers with our waiter. Great stuff! I would go back anytime I'm in Paris.;juin-19;Boutary
2;Good Gourmet food in Paris;5.0;I have eaten in 5 continents.I recommend the seafoods at this restaurant. The chef takes pride in his food. Food looked as good as it tasted. French haute cuisine better than some of the more expensive restaurants in Paris. This is a rare 5 star rating for me. We will return.;juil-19;Boutary
2;How fine dining should be;5.0;Although the cozy, casual setting doesn't inspire confidence that the cooking will be at a high level, let me assure you it is world-class. Every single thing they served us was beautiful, creative, flavorful (naturally, not by adding salt) and cooked to perfection. They were equally adept with meats as with seafood, the latter being the stronger offering if pressed to pick one. Mains were as good as starters, and desserts were also brilliant - light, flavorful, complex, balanced and plated beautifully. Service was relaxed, attentive and knowledgeable about both the food and wine, We ate lunch here and it was so good that we chose to have dinner here on the same day! In summary, my wife and I both loved this place for its relaxed atmosphere, amazing food and helpful service.;juin-19;Boutary
2;Lovely;4.0;Nice service. Lovely food with interesting tastes.The wine selections were pretty good!High prizes, but it is understandable with this level of quality and high end product. The value is actually the only thing stopping me from giving 5*.Would go here again!;avr-19;Boutary
2;caviar heaven;5.0;A lovely restaurant specialised in caviar and modern French cuisine. Attentive and knowledgeable service. The food was delicious with layers of flavor. The wine pairing was perfection. Highly recommend this little gem.;juin-19;Boutary
2;Delicious food and excellent service;5.0;Very good food and great value for the money if you take the lunch menu. The waiter was really friendly, helpful and knowledgeable. Would definitely go there again!;juin-19;Boutary
2;Beluga caviar A to Z!!!;5.0;This has to be one of our favorite and unique restaurant experiences in recent years. I chose this establishment due to its focus on caviar. We had visited several famous caviar places over the past few years only to be informed that they were “out of caviar”!This is not the case at “Boutary”. In fact, they farm their own sturgeon in Bulgaria so supply is not an issue! We decided to go all out and chose the tasting menu with the Beluga caviar course to start and wine pairings. Charles, our waiter was phenomenal. He gave us all kinds of information regarding the caviar, the wines, the vodka and the amazing food.Every single course was a delight to include roasted pigeon. The two desserts to complete the experience were amazing. Not only was the food superb, the presentation of every course was a piece of art. We cannot recommend this place too highly. If you are in Paris be sure to take in this beautiful experience.;juin-19;Boutary
2;Excellent restaurant, excellent food presented in a very beautiful way;5.0;The Boutary is an excellent example of a top restaurant combining French traditional food revisited visually and with subtle adjustments to make it unique.If course the caviar needs to be tested and I suggest the wine pairing which is well done.Staff is friendly. Desserts are not only looking amazing but are tasting great too.;juin-19;Boutary
2;Amazing food with superb service;5.0;Living in Los Angeles, California, I enjoy food of from many different countries. But I had not developed appreciation for French cuisine after many years of trying. When I had a chance to visit France in 2017, I was determined to try various well known local restaurants recommended by TripAdvisor.com and other rating agencies. Boutary was one of the restaurants that we visited and tried some recommended dishes by previous patrons. My wife and I became a fan of Boutary not just for the excellent food but also because of an on-site caviar specialist by the name of Frederic. He was knowledgeable, kind, likable,and patient in every way and made our dinging experience exceptionally entertaining. He took time to answer all questions from me and my wife with a warm smile. His unsophisticated manner also made us feel welcome and important throughout the dinner. My wife and I went back to Boutary after 2 years in March 2019. To my amazement, Frederic greeted us by our name and even remembered the table at which we sat the previous time. Feeling at home immediately, my wife and I thoroughly enjoyed the food and caviar the second time around. Because of Boutary, my wife and I started appreciating French cuisine and venturing into other French restaurants in the US. Boutary is the favorite spot for me and my wife. I also recommend it to all my family and friends.;mars-19;Boutary
2;Simply the best;5.0;This was the first time my wife and I had visited this lovely restaurant. The ambience was quiet and relaxed: comfortable seats well spaced, soft lighting that nevertheless allowed you to read the menu, beautiful furnishings - and, wonder of wonders, no background music, just the sound of quiet conversation. The service was equally wonderful: warm, friendly, beautifully efficient and unobtrusive. Above all, there is the food. It’s among the best we’ve tasted in Paris or elsewhere. We went for the tasting menu, with accompanying wines. Every course was first rate: complex, nuanced and a treat for both the eye and the palate. We felt completely satisfied by the end of the meal without feeling that we had eaten too much. There was just the right balance between heartiness and delicacy. Why this restaurant doesn’t have a Michelin star or two mystifies us. The quality of the food, service and overall experience, in our opinion, easily surpasses that of many Michelin starred restaurant we’ve visited - and, for that matter, every Michelin starred restaurant we’ve visited in the USA. Given that, it’s stunning value for money. My wife and I can’t recommend this restaurant too highly. If you’re in Paris and you love fine dining, do go there.;mai-19;Boutary
2;Superb Tasting Menu;5.0;This is a small and exclusive restaurant in a relatively quiet street in the 6th. The tasting menu was superb, including their excellent signature caviar, a great monkfish dish with an emulsion of scallop and mussel, and a perfectly prepared and vey tender Spanish angus steak. The serving staff was knowledgeable and provided good recommendations for wines. We had a table on the ground floor, and there are more tables upstairs, but a reservation is probably a good idea.;juin-19;Boutary
2;Very very poor service;1.0;Wait half an hour to orderVery disappointingAnd i went there many times for businessSo very varying upon days;mai-19;Boutary
2;Incredible Everything;5.0;Service was the best we’ve had in Europe. Food was absolutely fantastic. It was not only delicious, but thoughtfully sourced and prepared with a beautiful presentation. Our server was incredibly knowledgeable about the source of the ingredients and wine (which was amazing). Highly recommend.;mai-19;Boutary
2;Excellent Service + Food;5.0;Had the Chef selection with wine pairing. Totally worth it. Each course matches very well with the respective wine. The Dessert was truly amazing.;mai-19;Boutary
2;Even Better the Second Time Around!;5.0;Having eaten at Boutary last March with my family, I was eager to return with a colleague while on a work trip. I dare say it was even better the second time around. Both times we ordered the tasting menu with wine pairings. Since the menu continually changes, I will come here every time I'm in Paris. The dishes were light and refreshing. The only course that was the same from March 2018 was the caviar, and I was thrilled that it did not differ. The sous vide potatoes are such an amazing complement to the caviar. The soup course was like nothing I'd ever tasted, sort of a pea gazpacho. For me, the monkfish was the highlight and I've never had quinoa that tasted so amazing. The dessert was absolutely amazing and the perfect ending to a stunning five course meal. The meal is an investment, but frankly is a bargain for the quality of food and wine that you are served.;mai-19;Boutary
2;Excellent meal, service and ambiance;5.0;We enjoyed a great tasting menu paired with wines and superb service. Very unusual and creative menu with beautiful presentations. Decor of restaurant was bright and welcoming. Were were on the same floor as the kitchen and could see the staff at work taking pleasure in their creations.;mai-19;Boutary
2;correct;4.0;we had a table upstairs and were welcomed by the friendly maître. Nice venue, but if you're not 100% fit, ask for a table downstairs. We went for the 'carte blanche' with caviar tasting. We got a rather correct portion of Beluga for the 19€ they charge (with good information), served on the back of your hand (but you can opt for mother of pearl spoons). A wet towel should have been presented so you can clean your hand and remove perfume of handcream. An appetizer and two starters came very quick one after another, so we had to ask for a pause. The smoked mashed potatoes with siberian caviar was nice. Mains were a very good monkfish with oriental inspiration and a good black angus with asparagus. We went for the strawberries dessert, which was a delight. Nice winelist, correct prices.;mai-19;Boutary
2;Best restaurant in Paris;5.0;Boutary is a fantastic restaurang, with extremely nice and service-minded staff. The caviar-testing procedure is extraordinary and the food magic.This was my third time at Boutary and I brought 20 persons who all were ecstatic over the food.;mai-19;Boutary
2;A little red door...;5.0;We, a family of four, had a Very Nice visit here on my 50th birthday. We had the tasting menu, and it was all extremely Good! Our youngest is a vegetarian, and the made Small changes for her to enjoy the menu AS Well, without any fuss. We had a table on the ground floor, the room har no Windows, But Its painted i Bright colours, so you dont mind the closed space. Overall a Very Nice evening ! Oh, and they specialize in caviar.....));mai-19;Boutary
2;Decadent fun meal;5.0;We enjoyed the degustation menu, wine flights and caviarotheque. Amazing meal, great service. Simply excellent. Fantastic treat for my husbands 30th which the restaurant marked with macarons and a candle.;mai-19;Boutary
2;Caviar;5.0;For context, my husband and I visit Boutary (almost) exclusively for caviar though we have tried several of their (amazing) starters. We have been to Boutary a total of 4-5 times over the years and love it more with each visit. Whether you're a caviar novice or with sophisticated pallets, you're in good hands and will learn a lot from your hosts at Boutary. Cozy atmosphere and welcoming staff. We highly recommend.;mai-19;Boutary
2;Valerie Kung from Hong Kong;5.0;Good service, excellent food especially the different caviars,  our must go restaurant in Paris every time we are here!;avr-19;Boutary
2;Excellent dinner and service;5.0;The food is excellent. THe waiter is very nice and friendly.The service is phenomenal. The best meal we had in Paris;mai-19;Boutary
2;Terrific Dinner in St Germain de Pres;5.0;Terrific set meal with wine pairings. Didn't realize they specialized in caviar -- and haven't like it before -- but one of the dishes in the meal had it and it was the first time I enjoyed it. Service was excellent and meal very enjoyable with a nice mix of dishes. Highly recommend.;mai-19;Boutary
2;Great tasting menu;5.0;We went for tasting menu and paired standard wines (as opposed to premium). Five delightful courses. Restaurant has good vibe, staff friendly, food great - what more can you ask for.Highly recommended.;mai-19;Boutary
2;Spot on;5.0;Tasting menu with a flight of wines. Supper for two at this unpretentious, friendly, cosy restaurant with a delicious menu full of surprises. Would heartily recommend.;mai-19;Boutary
2;Can't recommend enough;5.0;If you're in or anywhere near Paris this is a MUST visit! This restaurant completely made our trip to Paris. It was exceptional, we opted for the 5 course taster menu as recommended by our waiter. The two starters we had were Devine, one with Caviar and the other a vegetable one, the steak main was the most perfectly cooked steak I've ever had and the desserts were faultless as well. The waiters made our visit, they were so well educated on every course we had, as well as the wine list. The sample wine (or tasting menu, can't remember what it was called) menu was amazing! some of the nicest wines we have ever had and if you didn't like the one that came they brought something better suited for you. A must visit, can't recommend enough.;avr-19;Boutary
2;Excellent food, friendly staff, beautiful decor;5.0;My husband and I celebrated our anniversary at le boutary. We were both very impressed. I highly recommend this restaurant. It was pricey but so worth it.;avr-19;Boutary
2;Amazing food and exceptional service;5.0;We opted for the 5-course tasting menu and wasn't disappointed. Each course was a surprise until the food arrived when the waiter took the time to explain in detail what we were eating and the history behind it. We even got a lesson on how to eat the caviar - which was really worth it! The waiters were very knowledgable and polite and the service exceptional.;avr-19;Boutary
2;Excellent food and even better service;5.0;We went there for lunch because it has been recommended to us. We reserved a table upfront - however at lunch time it doesn't seem to busy. The waiter spent plenty of time with us explaining all the details about the food, and made some recommendations - which we followed, for both food and wine. It was not a cheap menu, but it was worth it.;avr-19;Boutary
2;Outstanding experience from beginning to end.;5.0;We went to Boutary to celebrate a marriage. From the start we were made to feel most welcome. The food was excellent: creative, light, varied and delicious throughout the four course menu. Everything flowed including an excellent wine recommendation, interesting explanations on food and a generous celebration for the newlyweds. We could not have chosen a better place for this important occasion. Merci Boutary!;avr-19;Boutary
2;Excellent;5.0;Excellent ambiance, service, and delicious food. The caviar was especially impeccable. They made my daughter's birthday special!;avr-19;Boutary
2;Absolutely spectacular food, could not praise it highly enough.;5.0;I think I've written two reviews that I can remember during my ten years on TripAdvisor .... one because the place was just *completely* rubbish and the other was a yogurt hut in Dublin that needed a hand ... and closed down anyway! So, cracking open the laptop and stitching together a legible review of an eatery is not something I consider a particularly enjoyable exercise, my point really being that I am not one of these pseudo-semi-professional reviewers that seem to get a bit of craic out of forensically dissecting every meal they've ever seen. To flesh out my character further, I think people who take pictures of their dinner should be banished for eternity to a bitter island on the edge of Europe (yes, I mean Britain).Despite all these protestations, here I am. And it certainly appears that I am typing...Listen, Boutary is just unbelievably good food. The Lobster starter is probably the best dish I've eaten in my life. its nearest competitor for that honor is the Langoustine main, which is battling for first but, Liverpool-like, has been pipped at the proverbial by the aforementioned Lobster (Manchester City in this awkward analogy). Service is quick and friendly, the lads all seemed dead sound and were not (overtly) put out by my total lack of French. The street outside was buzzing, the city was alive. The best of Paris. Allez les Bleus and then some.;avr-19;Boutary
2;Amazed ❤;5.0;Our first day in Paris and we decided to head out and try this highly ranked restaurant! It didn’t disappoint. Food was phenomenal and the waiter was attentive. Price was acceptable given the quality of the food and the wine chosen by the waiter matched the food perfectly! Will return for sure!!!;avr-19;Boutary
2;Amazing food, lovely place and wonderful staff;5.0;We had tasting menu and everything was just so great. The waiter told us a lot about each dish and difference of beluga caviar, and they were really nice to talk with and seemed really interested.The atmosphere is relaxed but stylish. I really want to go there again.;mars-19;Boutary
2;Exquisite;5.0;I read about this restaurant, and still I stayed nearby, I made a reservation for dinner. I was not disappointed. I decided to trust the chef and went with a 5-course tasting menu. It was just exquisite. Very creative. Heavenly flavors. Recommended wines were just right. Quite pricey, but I felt that it was worth it. I highly recommend this for foodies.;mars-19;Boutary
2;Wonderful food, lovely restaurant;5.0;This restaurant is exceptional. We had the taster menu and paired wines. One if the best meals we have ever had and nothing was too much trouble for the staff. Excellent service, food and wine. Can’t fault it.;mars-19;Boutary
2;Excellent dinner;5.0;Fantastic evening dinner. We had the 5 course taster meal and each dish was perfection. Attentive service and cosy enviroment. Well worth every penny!;mars-19;Boutary
2;Wonderful--get the tasting menu with wine pairing;5.0;A friendly place with excellent food. Really enjoyed the evening. The tasting menu with wine pairing is really reasonable--go for it.;mars-19;Boutary
2;Bon Boutary!;5.0;Tasting menu and wine flight with caviar were superb. Gluten free adaptations for all courses and great understanding of any food intolerance or alergy. Service excellent, perfect English and great explanation of each course and the caviar. Lovely relaxing ambience.Highly recommend as an indulgent treatThank you Boutary!;mars-19;Boutary
2;Great tasting menu!;5.0;We tried the daily 5 course tasting menu which was priced at €86 excluding wine. Totally worth it - the flavours were perfectly balanced and different. Their signature dish the Pomme de Terre with the caviar was to die for.;mars-19;Boutary
2;Blown Away;5.0;I was blown away with the service. I found this place online and made a reservation before I got there and I was just amazed with everything. I did the sample plates and the caviar blind-tasting. The waiter was amazing and very knowledgeable. I would 10/10 Recommend for some fun Parisian food!;mars-19;Boutary
2;Unmissable!;5.0;Boutary was an unmissable experience. The tasting menu and wine pairing were faultless, and the service exceptional, to the extent that the Caviar tasting at the start and the vodka digestif at the end were the top and tail of an educational experience in what, in the right hands, a special meal out can be! Please do take the time to visit - you will be very happy you did!;mars-19;Boutary
2;The best in Paris;5.0;I ate lunch special with 4 menues (55 euros). It was the best foods ever among I had in France. From appetite to desert every plate was perfect!! The waiter is also very kind and has good manners and can speak at least 4 languages!! I strongly recommed this restairant.;févr-19;Boutary
2;Loving evening with fabulous service;5.0;Some of my friends mentioned this restaurant to us and we finally found sometime to check it out. I found it to be a very stylish restaurant with a relaxing and soothing atmosphere. The ambiance was well accompanied by the friendly and welcoming staff! I was nervous about a possible language barrier for such a lovely restaurant, however I was pleasantly surprised by the kindness, and english speaking, server who wonderfully walked us through the menu. Above all, the food was quite amazing !;févr-19;Boutary
2;Phenomenal location for a romantic dinner;5.0;We found this restaurant on open table because we wanted to make reservations for a specific time. I can’t say enough about the ambiance, the staff, and the food. The servers are simply lovely. They speak wonderful English and explained the menu and each item to us. We decided to do the chef’s tasting menu with the caviar to begin and selected wines with each course. Some of our group had not had caviar and the server gave a lovely explanation of the characteristics to look for when tasting this delicacy. Each course was wonderful and the wines were paired perfectly. I’m sure the individual items on the menu are equally tasty, but I recommend allowing the incredibly talented chef to choose your selections with the tasting menu.;févr-19;Boutary
2;Excellent fine dining experience, especially for lunch!;5.0;We had the 3 course lunch option which was exceptional. The fish entree and lamb main were mouth watering. Having tried a lot of lamb preparations, this lamb in particular was sous-vide to perfection. Out of the two dessert options, the one with the apple flavours had various textures and worked very well together. The host was exceptional and was very easy to talk to and made an extra effort to recommend wines and talk through the ingredient with us.;févr-19;Boutary
2;Not close to par!;2.0;We were here with family, friendly service but the tasting menu was not at all close to expectations and price level. First entree a strange mix of artichoke and fois gras and bread! Ok still enthusiast, we got the caviar Potato entree which was good! First main dish, the fish was not at all tasty and look of it I do not want to comment! Second main was a piece tough meat from Spain and sides that were nothing special! Two deserts to chose from! Mine was not my favorite, rum, cake, grapefruit sorbet and orange, but the other one the rest of the family liked! Sorry can not describe!;févr-19;Boutary
2;Simply outstanding!;5.0;I chose this restaurant because ofIt’s caviar menu. It certainly lived up to expectations in that regard. However, the food in general is simply sublime. I had the tasting menu with wine pairing and am so pleased I did. Every course blew me away and the chosen wines a perfect match. The staff were a joy, friendly, attentive, fun and extremely knowledgeable and passionate. I learnt so much about caviar!My ten year old daughter ate with me, and she is the caviar lover so really it was her who chose this restaurant. She was so impressed with the food and the wonderful staff. It made a real impression on her. We both agreed that a relatively simple potato dish was one of the most delicious things we’d ever eaten.;janv-19;Boutary
2;Caviar & Wine Pairing!;5.0;This was our first and probably favorite restaurant during our visit to Paris. Our waiter was very nice and recommended the caviar and wine pairing, which were both very satisfying. The restaurant had a very intimate feel to it, but my wife and I really enjoyed our unique dining experience here.;févr-18;Boutary
2;A worthwhile expensive indulgence!;5.0;We contacted the restaurant in advance. We had incredible, attentive service from Frederic. Three of us had the special five course menu--unusual combinations of flavors and textures beautifully presented. Frederic made it worthwhile!;déc-18;Boutary
2;Best restaurant ever;5.0;We visited Boutary on a whim on our last night in Paris and it was the best meal of the trip. We got the tasting menu with paired wines. Wait staff was extremely knowledgeable, personable, and full of interesting facts and stories. Food was incredible, impeccably presented. The wine was spectacular. They specialize in caviar and it is not to be missed. Chef came out to meet us at the end of the meal, which was a lovely and appreciated touch! This is one of our new favourite restaurants and we will visit every time we return to Paris. Do not hesitate, make a reservation and prepare to be blown away!;janv-19;Boutary
2;Best meal we had in Paris;5.0;Boutary is one of a kind - the best meal we had in Paris, and among the best dining experiences I've ever had.What made it so spectacular? Well, the food of course was great. the chef (we were told) had been the #2 at a well-known restaurant. We did the prix fixe menu with the wine pairing and the caviar tasting. The first two wine pairings in particular were interesting - a Riesling from Alsace and a white Burgundy paired well with the early courses and were really nice, even though neither of us typically drinks white.But as good as the food and wine were, what made Boutary so memorable was the service. It is difficult to deliver exceptional service that is at the same time friendly, funny, engaging, and informative. But the team that served us on Jan 1st did just that. A caviar expert for the caviar tasting, who taught us how the caviar was produced and how to best enjoy it (my first time). the sommelier who explained the wine pairings, the regions, how they were meant to complement each dish. the waiter who helped us understand what we were eating, and how it was prepared (painstakingly, it turns out - and with great skill!). It is difficult to be formal without being pretentious, while putting guests at ease. These gentlemen were really, really good at what they do.Thanks for a really special dinner, Boutary. A highlight of our trip to Paris!;janv-19;Boutary
2;Amazing food;5.0;A very memorable meal on New Year's Day. Every course surpassed the next—a sign of excellence. Don't miss the caviar tasting with a shot of iced Purity vodka. Service was friendly and well-informed. Never felt rushed. Would go back in a second. One of the highlights of our Paris dining.;janv-19;Boutary
2;Great meal and fun caviar tasting;5.0;We truly enjoyed an evening at this restaurant. We started with a blind caviar tasting with vodka andt then had the tasting menu. Wonderful food and service.;juil-18;Boutary
2;Romantic meal;5.0;Amazing food and amazing service can’t recomed highly enough! Waiters were excellent at explaining what each dish was and where is came from aswell as the wine to go with it, would deffinetly go again.;janv-19;Boutary
2;Wonderful dining place;5.0;After reading the trip advisor reviews we entered the restaurant with great expectation. We took the menu and I must say that it lived up to our expectations! Service was excellent, timing perfect, food super. Important is that the tastes of the main ingredients were enhanced rather than camouflaged by the sides as so often happens in star restaurants. The wine suggestions were also up to the standard,;janv-19;Boutary
2;Very Good Meal.. not what we expected;4.0;We thought we were going to a caviar tasting restaurant. Yes we ordered the Beluga tasting which was spreading the caviar on the top of our hand and tasting its saltiness. There was no more. 40 euros. Okay, we proceeded to the dinner which was excellent but we could not figure out the relationship to the caviar. We took the tasting menu. Overall service was slow, the servers were delightful... but too long an evening. I can’t say I’d recommend..yes it’s expensive, yes it was very good..but the restaurant has to have a direction it’s going in...to survive;déc-18;Boutary
2;Excellent for caviar and the duck;4.0;In most respects, the restaurant has a nice cozy atmosphere. I can tell the staff and Maitre'd are really knowledgeable about their food and wine, so, while they don't have a fancy set up or Michelin stars or the tons of after meal treats and all, the preparation and treatment of food is like fine dining. The range of caviar is amazing, and I learned more about caviar from dining here, which I really enjoyed. The dishes in the chef's selected tasting menu were all wonderfully prepared, but I would like to specially highlight the duck breast main course. It was perfect. The skin was nicely crisped, with just enough fat, while the meat had a nice bite, mouthfeel and flavour, while being just the correct doneness and tender enough.;déc-18;Boutary
2;Confused ...;4.0;"First of all let me say that this is an excellent restaurant with high quality food and a very cozy ""ambiance"". What got me confused is the beautiful pictures of the courses on the website and what we actually got. So expectations probably set too high and not met.What makes this restaurant stand out is their caviar specialty. You can taste several types of caviar from the traditional ones to those coming from their own farms.The explanation given with the tasting and the courses is very warm and passionate. The champagne was excellent, the courses very tasty and perfectly prepared. However, they were missing some creativity when we went.I definitely want to go back for a more thought through choice from the menu and I hope I can report back that the gap between expectations and delivery has been bridged (in the positive way).";déc-18;Boutary
2;Even Better the Second Time;5.0;We dined at Boutary last year for our anniversary. The entire experience was outstanding. This year we visited Paris a few weeks before our anniversary, but wanted to celebrate it again at Boutary. The Boutary team did not disappoint. When we arrived, we were amazed to find that they had remembered and saved for us the same table we ate at last year. Again, we ordered the chef's set dinner with the accompanying premium wines. The variety, artistry, and quality were excellent. What really sets Boutary apart is the atmosphere and reception. Frederic and his team create an elegant, yet completely friendly and approachable ambiance. It.s fun to be surprised with the chef's creations, with the notable exception of their signature appetizer, a divine concoction of smooth potato puree, caviar, and cream. Not to be missed! Every question is answered eagerly without a hint of stuffiness or condescension. While we were there, an individual woman without a reservation dropped in to see if there was any availability. As it happened, there was one small table available. She was treated with the same kindness and respect given to larger parties with advanced reservations (which we heartily recommend, and can be done easily through Trip Advisor). Its not cheap, but nevertheless good value for money for a satisfying and elegant dining experience.;nov-18;Boutary
2;Wow!;5.0;Visited for my husband’s 50th birthday. Exquisite food, beautifully presented with excellent service. We went for the 5 course taster menu, and added the caviar to start (one Beluga, one not for comparison) with the premium paired wines. Worth splashing for the extras. Our waiter was so knowledgeable about the caviar, food and wine and made it a really special occasion for us. The whole experience was extraordinary, one of our most memorable ever meals. Go for the taster menu and wines and put your trust in the extraordinary kitchen and front-of-house staff, you won’t regret it.;déc-18;Boutary
2;Excellent food, although expensive.....;5.0;With the blind tasting and an additional caviar tasting, with a bottle of wine it was just over €250. Had the portions been a little bigger, I would have been fully satisfied with the price but I can’t fault the food or service in any way. The atmosphere is chic with the red and white walls and there is a great attention to detail. The additional caviar tasting was €19 and we are now converts!;déc-18;Boutary
2;Perfect in every way;5.0;We celebrated our anniversary at Boutary. Our meal was perfect in every way. The carafe of Swedish vodka set the tone for the evening. Happy! We do not usually eat caviar but we did and it was delicious. Our waiter, Frederic, was professional, accommodating and very sweet. I highly recommend this restaurant, and look forward to returning next year.;nov-18;Boutary
2;Wedding dinner at Boutary;5.0;We booked the upstairs dining room for our wedding dinner and we are so satisfied with the evening that we had. It was truly a first-class experience from start to finish. The staff was helpful and professional, with great language skills and an impressive knowledge of the food and wine that was served. In the months leading up to the dinner we were in correspondence with the restaurant (Charles in particular) and they were utterly professional and forthcoming. In our entourage we had guests with several allergies but this was all accounted for in the menu. The head chef even designed a special dish to satisfy a request of ours, including escargots and foie gras, which was one of the absolute high marks of the dinner. The only thing that could have been even better was the selection of non-alcoholic beverages since we had some guests that prefer to not drink alcohol. All in all, we would like to thank the crew at Boutary for a memorable evening that was even more than we could ever have wished for. We are looking forward to come back and celebrate an anniversary at Boutary in the future.Best regards Emma & Johan;nov-18;Boutary
2;Superb;5.0;Small but stylish restaurant. We were warmly welcomed. Initially we were seated by the bar, but asked to be moved to avoid noise from the coffee machine. Our window table was much better.The menu offers limited choice, but every one of the five dishes we had between the two of us was delicious. Full marks for taste and especially for refined presentation. Portion sizes were perfect. Excellent wine list, although quite pricey. Neither of us is a fan of caviar (which can be added to several dishes at extra cost), but we were very impressed by the enthusiasm and knowledge of the waiter explaining the various varieties to the next table.You need to book. You won't regret it.;nov-18;Boutary
2;Amazing eating;5.0;Very good fine dining experience.Saw the good reviews we decided to give this restaurant a try.Good selection wine and the food is good.One of the best caviar ever.Nice atmosphere.Highly recommend.;nov-18;Boutary
2;Amazing dinner and nice introduction to Caviar;5.0;Friday night dinner where we chose to go with the chef’s menu and included a small caviar tasting. The dinner was delicious throughout and the paired wines were also spot on. Frederick and the other waiters provided friendly and attentive service, with the right level of introduction and information about each dish.We also had the perfect introduction to Caviar, -for a very reasonable price Boutary provides a small tasting and gives enjoyable and confident guidance!This restaurant embodies much of what we love about the food and ambience in Paris! Highly recommended!;nov-18;Boutary
2;Superb lunch;5.0;Stopped in for their set menu lunch (29€), and initially the only patrons in the restaurant, so had the server’s full attention. Funky decor, and you don’t have to dress up. We ended up starting with the additional 9.5 pp caviar, having only ever had the cheaper version. It was exceptional in taste, and not salty at all...but be warned, you only get a small spoonful. Our appetizer course included a veloute with eel and foie gras, which was heavenly in flavour (and I’m not an eel fan!) Our mains were the scallops on endive, a good mixture of umami, bitter and sweet, which partnered nicely with the scallops. Overall, a very nice meal with great service, and free wifi. Highly recommended.;nov-18;Boutary
2;fully deserves its high ranking;5.0;This was the best food of a 3 night trip....all the food was exceptional...lobster with foie gras...pigeon and a sublime pear dessert. I really enjoyed the wine by the glass selection (depends on what they have open). Service was faultless and prompt. And whilst expensive, its not the crazy prices of more upscale places in the city. Take care to book in advance...its worth it.I will definitely return;nov-18;Boutary
2;Service and food were all spectacular;5.0;Just finishing my meal at Boutary. Truly excellent from the Brittany lobster, the monkfish and then the pear dessert. Everything tonight was exceptional, including the service. I ordered just what the waiter suggested and it was a treat.;nov-18;Boutary
2;Amazing;5.0;The entire experience was amazing. We had the 5 course chef’s choice menus. Everything was outstanding, even the bread! The wine parings was delicious. The atmosphere was rather casual. The service was terrific! Enjoy!;oct-18;Boutary
2;If you like caviar and learn more about it, then this is the place for you;4.0;"If you like caviar and want to learn more about caviar, then this is the place for you. At the helm is Jay Wook Hur, Japanese-Korean chef, where a lot of his Asian influences can also be seen in his dishes. Aesthetically simple and beautiful to the eye. The service was beyond reproach. Each server took the time to explain the various nuances of different caviars and also the wines. You would think you'd get tired of repeating the same spiel over and over, but they were very enthusiastic about the caviar, which you could tell.As for the food, I thought it was interesting. My favorite caviar was the Beluga. My favorite entrée was the foie gras. As for the plat, my favorite was the duck. And, lastly for dessert it was the chocolate.My least favorite was the fish, it tasted ""fishy"" to me. What I didn't particularly care for were the utensils. They were very long and narrow and hard to eat with. As for the coffee, I had to ding them on this, it came out barely lukewarm. Would we go back? absolutely. It's not an inexpensive restaurant so we'd have to save our pennies first.";nov-18;Boutary
2;Nice caviar with good food;5.0;Staff were friendly, with good knowledge of caviar, good quality of food, suggest to pair with champagne or wine.;nov-18;Boutary
2;New experience and fun;5.0;Seek out this two year old tiny gem in the Arts district. The name is derived from caviar, if which they serve several types. They have their own beluga farm and took great pride in sturgeon education. Chef Leo cooked my fish with such care and precision. His Asian flair and roots show through. Loved his potatoes with nori and caviar. Considering how much money one drops at Paris eateries, the Boutary marked the best food for the price. Do the tasting menu at only 89e;nov-18;Boutary
2;An Incredible Experience!;5.0;We went as a Business Group of 8 having no idea what to expect and we were treated to a fascinating history of Caviar by our fabulous host! The food was amazing throughout the evening and washed down by equally amazing vodka! Not to be missed when in Paris!;oct-18;Boutary
2;Supern;5.0;What a fantastic restaurant, worthy of its place in the Michelin guide. Tucked away in the trendy Marais district of Paris, not too far from Notre Dame cathedral, surrounded by many independent shops and galleries, it is a small red fronted building which doesn’t look much from the outside.However, the food is nothing like the understated exterior. They offer either a 5 course tasting menu or a la Carter, and they seem to specialise in various types of caviar.The tasting menu was a real wow, specialising in classic French dishes with a a twist. Foie Gras with mussels, smoked potato with caviar, fresh pollock with cream sauce and fantastic duck with girolles and pumpkin. Dessert of pears with ginger was one of the best I’ve ever tasted.Service was impeccable - friendly, efficient and very knowledgable. If you in Paris, you should definitely make a trip to Boutary.;oct-18;Boutary
2;Real surprise find.;5.0;We were a large group (10) and we had a tasting menu with wine pairing. Everything was very good. We will come again.;oct-18;Boutary
2;A delightful evening in Paris;5.0;Our family of 4 dined at Boutary on our last night in Paris & enjoyed our experience immensely. The food was delicate & refined, the ambiance sophisticated without being intimidating, and our waiter was charming.We received a warm welcome & were given a choice of tables, settling on a spacious round one, where we were very comfortable.The highlight of the evening was their kind & thoughtful touch of a surprise miniature birthday dessert for my daughter, complete with candle! This was greatly appreciated by all of us.We commend Boutary's chef & all staff involved on their teamwork in providing such a memorable dining experience. We would not hesitate to recommend Boutary for a special evening out, with modern French cuisine and a non-touristic atmosphere. Bon appétit!;oct-18;Boutary
2;Fantastic!;5.0;A fantastic lunch. The lunch was great all around with wonderful caviar tasting and superb service. Will return with pleasure.;oct-18;Boutary
2;Amazing;5.0;Everything was simply amazing. Wonderful flavours, very nice people. I want to go back right now, best dining experience of the whole trip!;oct-18;Boutary
2;Outstanding French Cuisine;5.0;So much effort goes in to every dish, the menu is simple yet complex, the waiter understands the menu and its ingredients as if he procured them himself. The establishment did not just excel with fish, the meat and vegetables where equally amazing.Go, before it gets too hard to get a booking.;oct-18;Boutary
2;Seriously Excellent;5.0;We stay often in the St Germaine area and know many of the restaurants. This is among the very best. The menu is short because every dish is so complex and amazing. The dishes are as much “ composed” as they are cooked, and from the very best ingredients. You don’t have to like caviar ( an emphasis ) to eat here but maybe you should indulge and try it. I had pork which itself was complex and delicious but as an example the accompanying potato was made by shredding the raw potato in long sticks, blanching briefly, rinsing in cold water to stop the cooking and keep them firm, flash frying quickly, not browned just finished, with some mussels and I think a touch of a mild rice wine vinegar. That’s effort, that’s delicious, and that’s just for a small side. Service was the best at any restaurant this trip but knowledgeable friendly waiters who really help you enjoy your meal. Deserved the Michelin mention, and is not to be missed;oct-18;Boutary
2;Lovely lunch with friends;5.0;A special afternoon celebration  with friends. Wonderful service, intimate setting, delightful cuisine.;oct-18;Boutary
2;Fantastic dinner!!;5.0;We tried the tasting menu with caviar. Boutary is an excellent restaurant for fine dining. I believe I will have meal again every time I visit Paris.;sept-18;Boutary
2;Dinner;5.0;We had read the reviews but never expected such a great welcome and organization. The service was absolutely the best, no one could explain caviar like they did and just made it a very special experience. The food was very good only the fish a bit dry.Location and decor very unique.We have the intention to return soon.;sept-18;Boutary
2;Absolutely Amazing A Paris Must;5.0;To put it simply the food is divine. It was all absolutely incredible. And it did not break the bank for a classic french meal. For four people only cost 150 euros. The food was out of this world definitely make the Boutaty part of you’re trip;oct-18;Boutary
2;One of the best in Paris -- exceptional, comfortably, not stuffy;5.0;Many high end great restaurants in Paris -- but sometimes you want exceptional cuisine without the four hour time commitment, €150 appetizers and attitude. When this is what you want, Boutary is the right place. Exceptional food and presentation -- great wine list -- excellent service -- comfortable ambiance. Highly recommended.;oct-18;Boutary
2;Oh no! What happened?;2.0;We dined at Boutary during or visit to Paris last year. If was amazing. I was so excited to dine again during our visit this year. Last year, the meal was special. The combination of flavor and texture in the food was exceptional. Tonights meal was totally different. The flavors were decent, but not exceptional. The textures were good on two of the five dishes, but missed the mark on three of the dishes. It was like the restaurant was under new ownership (I don't think this is the case). I heard the owner opened a new restaurant and was at the new restaurant during our meal. Makes sense to me since the dining experience we had tonight was shockingly poor. Based on last year's experience, I would have put Boutary on the list of my favorite restaurants of all time. Tonight I took Boutary off my list and will not go back. Too bad.;oct-18;Boutary
2;Very nice;4.0;We went here on the basis of the reviews and comments on TripAdvisor. My wife and i had the tasting menu with the premium wine pairing. The service was excellent and the food very good. That being said, the expense of the meal was quite significant compared to experience. This was my only concern.;oct-18;Boutary
2;Simply Superb;5.0;We had a fantastic evening here dining from the A La Carte Menu. The tasting menu was hard to resist, and perhaps another time (after a smaller lunch!) we may have chosen this.but what we had was absolutely delicious and elegant. Strongly recommend for a special evening meal in Paris.;août-18;Boutary
2;Delicious Food and Great Service;5.0;We were lucky enough to get a table at Boutary on the same day that we called. The top restaurants in Paris seem to get booked up very quickly no matter what day of the week or month of the year it is! The restaurant had two floors. We were seated downstairs which was small, but beautifully decorated (modern). Our server Frederick was fantastic. Very helpful in his recommendations and explanations, and he also gave us some information on the origins of the restaurant and Paris in general. We got vodka recommendations too! We did not try the tasting menu since we had done that at a few other restaurants and just wanted to choose what we wanted on this occasion. Everything was excellent. We had the John Dorey, crab salad, blue lobster, pork, and the chocolate and peach desserts. The hotel fully deserves its great reputation since everything was beautifully presented, really delicious, good sized portions and not pretentious and overpriced as we found in some other establishments. It was on a small street that I don’t think we would have found on our own if we had taken the metro. Luckily we opted for a taxi. Loved this restaurant!;sept-18;Boutary
2;Surpassed our expectations;5.0;We only had one night in Paris and were after a special dinner experience, Boutary was wonderful. We chose the set menu and each course was amazing. Not being local we left the wine choices to the marvellous Fréderic, needless to say his choices were delightful. The wonderful service completed the experience. Fréderic and his colleagues were charming and knowledgeable.We would recommend to anyone looking for a special dining experience to dine at Boutary. I will remember this meal for years to come. Cheers to you Fréderic;sept-18;Boutary
2;Fantastic place;5.0;Went all in with tasting menu, beluga caviar and premium wine menu, and had a fantastic night out with my wife. Very helpful and informative waiters. Would absolutely recommend. 300 Eur for 2.;sept-18;Boutary
2;Anniversary Dinner;5.0;"My wife and I celebrated our 50th anniversary dinner at Boutary and were not disappointed by the cuisine and the service. Our five course meal began with the caviar and vodka and finished with a delightful dessert. It was interesting that Boutary sources its caviar from Bulgarian sturgeon, producing a variety of caviars, including the outstanding beluga we began with.In the seven nights we spent in Paris, Boutary provided out best dining and service experience. The caviar beginning provided an interesting ""hook"" that resisted defining it as ""kitschy"". On the contrary, we quite enjoyed it and would certainly return. We strongly recommend this Left Bank restaurant for a unique Paris dining experience.";août-18;Boutary
2;It surpassed all my spectations;5.0;We had an incredible night as the place, the service and the food were spectacular. Every plate explained in detail and presented beautifully. Our waiter went out of his way to make us feel confortable and welcomed. The portions were enough as we tryed the tasting menu with caviar. It exceeded our espectations every way and would highly recomend it. We were celebrating a birthday and did not informed them in advance but concocted a celebration arrangement with canddle at the end. We will make it our destination when ever we are in Paris again.;août-18;Boutary
2;Tasting Menu;5.0;Chef Jay’s tasting menu with wine pairings is fabulous. Each dish was so flavorful. I could taste the different flavors explode in my mouth. I highly recommend this restaurant. Reservations are required.;sept-18;Boutary
2;Amazing!;5.0;Business dinner.... with new colleagues!Hard to find this place but....it’s amazing and gorgeous!The service, the welcoming...the way to present the food!I’ll come back here again soon!!!;sept-18;Boutary
2;Great restaurant & Service;5.0;My wife and I were there for lunch. We had course menu which started off with fish followed by duck breast and finished with peach dessert. We must say we loved everything especially the fish (the sauce was beautifully flavoured) We would recommend this restaurant if you are looking for lovely lunch menu with reasonable price. Note: if you love caviar, this is the place for you!;août-18;Boutary
2;Good restaurant and good expierence;4.0;This restaurant is a great place to spend an evening with your partner. We were flabbergasted by the 5 course taster menu, which was an eye-opening experience for us. Even though it was a little bit too hot in there, we still fully enjoyed our visit in “Bountary”.;juil-18;Boutary
2;Superb flavours, interesting menu.;5.0;Given the popularity of this little restaurant, were lucky to secure a booking on a Saturday night! The food, service and wine selections were impressive. It is quite expensive though.;sept-18;Boutary
2;Amazing;5.0;The food the place the service is beyond amazing the waiters are knowledgeable about the menu they explain the taste of food with passion ! It’s a must if you are looking for a hidden gem in Paris!;août-18;Boutary
2;Amazing!!!!;5.0;If I could give more then 5 stars I would! Amazing food, wine, and service.. if you are in Paris this is more then just going out to dinner... This is a experience you will never forget! Boutary, WE WILL BE BACK...;août-18;Boutary
2;Tasting Dinner;5.0;We loved our experience in wsrm and inviting restaurant. no problems adjusting the tastingmenu for allergies. Great staff and spectacular food. No regrets here,;août-18;Boutary
2;Great lunch;5.0;We came here with friends as a start of a gourmet weekend in Paris. We expected good food and were surprised about the Excellency of the cooking, the presentation and the taste of the dishes. Definitely worth a visit!;août-18;Boutary
2;Great finish to our Paris trip;5.0;Had dinner here on our last night in Paris. It was a great farewell. Had the set menu, and each course was delicious (razor clam, caviar, sea bass, beef and desserts, all prepared in a sophisticated way). The service was first rate. The ambiance was very nice. We got the wine pairings with the dinner, which were fine, but not quite as excellent as the food. I absolutely recommend this place for a nice dinner.;juin-18;Boutary
2;Nice place with warm welcome;4.0;I like it when you go out to eat and the welcome is as if you were at a friends house. This is what you can expect at Boutary. The food and the wine were well paired and the range was really what you are looking for. It may be a little on the high side of pricing but I really enjoyed the whole experience especially the wine.;juin-18;Boutary
2;Big splurge in the heart of St Germain des Près;5.0;Save Boutary for a special occasion, go for the set price menu, with a great bottle of wine, and just enjoy the ride. Perfect introduction to caviar, the house's speciality, but also really good variety of meat and fish dishes. Service is extraordinary and the server event whipped out a book explaining different types of sturgeon and caviar. Everything is exquisite, superbly presented, an altogether magical ride. We went for a family engagement party, and there was simply no room for improvement.;déc-17;Boutary
2;Fabulous Introduction to Caviar;5.0;From the initial introduction to 4 different caviars complimented by a lovely non-vintage Rosé Champagne through to the desserts, this is a wonderful restaurant to be feted over by the excellent service and good wine pairings.If you are looking for a treat in the Left Bank of Paris, then I highly recommend this restaurant.;juil-18;Boutary
2;An amazing experience;5.0;We visited for a special dinner with friends to celebrate a 40th birthday.This was my first introduction to cavier and it is one I will never forget! The food, wine and the service was impeccable. Charles,the owners knowledge on cavier is excellent. I can highly recommend a visit! Thankyou for a wonderful night.;juil-18;Boutary
2;A special dinner;5.0;Best introduction to the world of Cavier, service was impeccable Charles was a great host and extremely knowledgeable beautiful wines and fantastic foodLove your outfit Charles and especially those historical buttons;juil-18;Boutary
2;Best meal in Europe;5.0;Can’t say enough good things. From the service to the food, it was absolutely perfect. We even learned about the differences in caviar.;juil-18;Boutary
2;Beyond!;5.0;I would agree with an earlier comment about how reviews (including those from the Michelin guides) both change restaurants and also begin to bring a different type of clientele. On it's own, Boutary is a fabulous establishment: many walk-ins were turned away because of the number of pre-bookings and I heard French, British English, Japanese and Americans all around me. I was pleasantly surprised when wait staff spoke Japanese, adding a warmth to the dining experience that was uncalled for but thoroughly enjoyed. Getting back to how reviews change restaurants... Dining that evening were other Americans and they made it abundantly clear they were unhappy with the toughness of the meat. I think they ruined their own meal all by themselves actually. I felt embarrassed both being American but also for the staff and chef. Nevertheless, it's about expectations: we were warned before hand that Americans tend to expect really tender, melt-in-your mouth meat at fine dining restaurants and it was explained that the beef, while considered some of the best in the world, was rugged and required chewing. With that in mind, my party was able to enjoy the experience immensely. The Americans on the other hand, asked for their meals to be taken back. Overall, I felt like apologizing to Boutary. You are on the right path. We could clearly taste the passion and careful thought in each bite. A bit of air conditioning would help but hey, it's about the food!;juil-18;Boutary
2;Is Michelin an empire of evil;4.0;No one has caused so much good and bad to the travel industry as the Michelin tire company with its green and red guides. The moment a site gets 3 stars in a green guide, you can be sure that it will be so flooded with tourists that you have to avoid it. The moment a restaurant gets one or more stars in the red guide, it stops serving food and starts serving gourmet food and hype. We had several meals at Michelin starred restaurants lately which left us deeply unsatisfied and full of doubt as to the future of the whole restaurant industry. so we were glad to try a restaurant in Paris which didn't have a Michelin star but was warmly recommended to us by friends. Happily we spent a satisfying evening at Boutary. The venue is intimate and pleasant. The service is friendly and efficient without becoming a nuisance. The food menu is very limited, but every dish was well prepared, tasty, of decent size, and without being overburdened by a host of superfluous and contrasting ingredients. The wine list is rather limited, but we managed to find a wine that pleased us and so would you. After all, do we really need a 300 pages wine list when all we want is a single bottle of good wine, Our only complaint was regarding the tasting of the caviar of the day which left us feeling a bit made fun of. Apart from that, we had a very enjoyable evening.;juil-18;Boutary
2;Amazing! Must try the caviar!;5.0;I absolutely loved my experience there. My husband and I went to Boutary to celebrate our 10th anniversary and were hoping for a truly elevated experience. However, I was scared that we would have a hard time understanding and knowing what we were eating- but that was not a problem at all! We had the set fixe menu and it was delightful. The caviar was amazing. The servers were not pretentious and explained everything and answered any questions. They were incredibly knowledgeable and accommodating. The ambiance was very romantic. What a beautiful experience!;juil-18;Boutary
2;Superb!;5.0;Every course of the tasting menu was an education in haute cuisine!The staff expertly guided you through all of the nuances of each ingredient and preparation, then gave you ample time to savor each bite. This is a meal worth every second of its 3.5 hr duration.;juil-18;Boutary
2;Awesome;5.0;What an excellent meal. The food was superb and the staff was friendly, enthusiastic, and attentive. Great value for the level of dining. The staff was also fluent in English and gave great descriptions of the food and wine for a table of French challenged individuals.;juil-18;Boutary
2;Amazing Experience;5.0;Delicious 5 course tasting menu and they deserve a Michelin star. Impeccable service and a very memorable night at Boutary!;juil-18;Boutary
2;Local experience;5.0;Despite there are lots of places in the area the restaurant certainly deserves a visit. Local people like it. Great food and excellent service.;juil-18;Boutary
2;superb, deserves 2 michelin stars for the food;5.0;I went here upon the recommendation of other Tripadvisor clients. What a fabulous surprise. It was my birthday, and it could not have been a better experience, Fabulous cuisine, we had the 5 course tatsing menu for 85 euros worth well more than that. Very subtle flavors, and so many of them, with some connections from one course to the next, We also had excellent champagne and a very good bottle of chablis. Superb service as well. We were there from 20h to midnight, never rushed, always savoring something unusual and supremely delicious and our glasses never empty. The young chef came out at the end, really talented, Rush to have this experience before he moves up and charges 3 times more, and has investors he has to cater to. The decor is fine, there was adequate air-conditioning on this unseasonably hot period. Quiet for long conversations. Most memorable, and one of the best meals I've had in Paris in decades of ilving here. Thanks to Tripadvisor for introducing me to a restaurant only open since 2 years and yet very close to where I live.;juil-18;Boutary
2;Good Food;5.0;I enjoyed most. This is the best place. I liked food and also the service was great. I highly recommend. The Dishes come out very perfectly and decorative.;juin-18;Boutary
2;Deserves 3 Michelin stars;5.0;On the day we dined at Boutary in July 2018, it was TripAdvisor’s 11th best restaurant out of 15,239 in Paris. As far as we’re concerned, it could have been # 1. It’s a smaller understated restaurant in an old charming building with painted wooden beams in the ceiling etc. We chose the 5 course degustation (€85) with optional superior wine pairing (€29, but cheaper options were available), rather than the interesting à la carte menu. We also selected the option of Beluga caviar for an additional €19, which was an excellent experience in itself. We eat in restaurants often, including fine dining, but this was equal to the best we’ve ever experienced. Each course was exquisite, both in taste and texture, the ambience was delightful, and the service excellent. We’ll certainly return to Boutary when we’re next in Paris.;juil-18;Boutary
2;Our anniversary dinner;4.0;The food was great, the place was a little too warm to enjoy the food. The air conditioning could be better. We had the tasting menu with wine. Right from The amuse bouche to the dessert the food was excellent.;juin-18;Boutary
2;Great restaurant with an interesting experience!;4.0;We took the 5 course taster menu and it definitely did not disappoint! Each plate that came out was more interesting than the first! Not only was the food presented beautifully but each dish came with a show! I would highly recommend this place if you enjoy trying new culinary delights and tasting delicious pairings of wine!;juil-18;Boutary
2;Great food with great service!;5.0;There is not much to say about this place! The food, which was prepared by a young chef, was really a highlight! Our waiter was really polite and you could really feel that he had done his homework! Every question was followed by profound and friendly answer! We had a great time;juin-18;Boutary
2;So good and classy;5.0;High end dinning, classy and tasty. people are very friendly smiling all the time. food is remarkably good and special. in addition to tge good food Caviar there is exquisite. it is a little pricey but for what you get ut s not. try it you ll come back for sure for every special occasion;juin-18;Boutary
2;Fantastic service and food;5.0;We had a wonderful experience at the Boutary. The staff was friendly, professional and helpful. The caviar tasting fun and interesting. The food beautiful and amazing.;juin-18;Boutary
2;creative and delicious meal;4.0;The tasting menu of 2 appetizers, one fish dish, one meat dish and one dessert was a feast for the eyes and tastebuds. It was pricey at 85 euro for five small courses but since each course was a delight to behold and we didn't leave hungry, I think it was worth the expense. The four of us savoured every morsel, be it potatoes and caviar, perfectly cooked veal, or cuttlefish with pickled carrots, and would not hesitate to return when up for a splurge. Very good meals can be had in Paris for much less but you would have to go to a Michelin starred place to get the artistry and texture combinations we enjoyed here.Service was lovely and we enjoyed Frederick, our helpful and friendly waiter.;juin-18;Boutary
2;Special Night;5.0;Had a superb dinner at Boutary for a super special birthday in May. Been on my bucket list for along time and so glad I chose Boutary .;mai-18;Boutary
2;Terrific;5.0;Boutary is terrific, especially for seafood. We loved it. Ambiance is charming.The abalone appetizer is outstanding. Both the dorade and the Guinea fowl were great. Can't comment on deserts because we skipped it.;mai-18;Boutary
2;Truly fabulous!;5.0;We arrived unexpectedly after a mistake with another reservation and we much appreciated that our reservation was moved up a day to accommodate us! Wonderful young, knowledgeable and very personable waiter explained each item of the delicious 5 courses and our matched wines. Our two celiac family members were graciously accomodated. A truly wonderful and delicious meal. Thank you Boutary! A highlight of our trip!;juin-18;Boutary
2;Awesome birthday lunch;5.0;Took my now fiancée here for lunch on her 40th birthday. Asked them to make a fuss of her and they did, subtly, without pretentiousness. I’m not a lover of fish but the food was amazing. Worth getting the caviar potato dish for the experience. Had the best G&T as an aperitif with a special cucumber tonic. It is expensive, but definitely worth it to mark a special occasion. Waiting staff are particularly good. Well informed too and ready to share their experience of the best way to enjoy Paris;juin-18;Boutary
2;AMAZING;5.0;This is just an AMAZING experience. In my opinion they actually deserve a Michelin Star. Since they do not have it (yet) the price is so sweet that it can just become an habit to go there. Service, gastronomy, ambiance, everything is there to make us spend 3h at the table and wanting more!;juin-18;Boutary
2;!;5.0;Finally a place in Paris that allows for the flavour of the dishes to speak and not only the artisticness of the plate. Great service, affordable wines and flavourable dishes! It might not be cheap but for a foodie its worth a visit! (Especially for some caviar);juin-18;Boutary
2;Excellent Tasting;5.0;We had a group of three for the five course tasting menu with classic wine parings. Each course was absolutely amazing and everything I had hoped for in a fancy French restaurant. One of our party had a shellfish allergy and the staff was extremely accommodating with other dishes or replacement sauces. The cuttlefish was cooked perfectly with small pieces of lime to add. The caviar and mashed potatoes were amazing, especially with the smoky reveal. We had so much fun and I wish I could go back!;juin-18;Boutary
2;Spectacular Tasting Menu;5.0;We had the five course tasting menu, and it seems so did everyone else when we were at Boutary. Dishes were a feast of tastes and presentation was beautiful. The caviar is a specialty and lives up to its expectations. Beer selection is limited, but they have one good craft beer. Service is particularly friendly and professional and the dinner at Boutary makes for a wonderful evening. Reservation seems a must.;juin-18;Boutary
2;Super supper;5.0;A wonderful meal with exceptional service in a City known for its food. A little caviar goes a long way and they are expert in its use. We did the tasting menu with wine pairing and were thrilled.;mai-18;Boutary
2;Excellent soirée;5.0;Very good food and wine. The menu was interesting and inventive. The wine selection selection was excellent. Ambience, décor and service all very good. Will definitely visit again and would highly recommend it.;mai-18;Boutary
2;A Most Excellent Experience;5.0;My sister, who loves Paris, decided to celebrate her 60th birthday at Boutary in Paris. I couldn't be with her as I was opening Perth's new Children's Hospital. Charles at Boutary was so wonderful, in helping me organize a delicious dessert and wine surprise for the party! There were so nice, discreet and trusting. My sister had a wonderful evening! Next time I am in Paris, I am most definitely going to Boutary!;mai-18;Boutary
2;Amazing food;4.0;I had a four course lunch. Every course was delicious. The caviar was atop a creamed potato of sorts. Just divine. The only thing was that they charged $7 Euros for water. Not sparkling water and I didn't even ask for it.;mai-18;Boutary
2;Excellent food and service;5.0;Went here with my wife after thorough TA research of best meal options in Paris. Got lucky with last minute reservations since the place is small. Simple but elegant decor. We were recommended great wine from a limited selection. All courses were delicious, well presented and described. Very friendly staff. Overall a great experience. Would do it again.;mai-18;Boutary
2;Amazing Eating;5.0;To say this was just a restaurant is an understatement. It’s an experience that’ll change your taste buds forever. The restaurant is very charming. The chairs were super comfortable which is good because we ate for like 3 hours. My family did the tasting menu and it was one of the best (if not the best) meals I’ve ever had.We added the caviar because why not? None of us had ever had it so not only did we expand our taste buds but the waiter explained a lot of about the process and the history. Kinda tasted like lox. The courses were well spaced out. Everything was well portioned. The silverware was changed each course. The waiters explained everything we were eating with great passion. I pictured the courses below because to describe them would not do them justice. The wine pairing added to the flavors. Service was impeccable. To call the team “waiters” is wrong. They were culinary experts that guided our taste buds through an amazing journey. I highly recommend Boutary.;mai-18;Boutary
2;Great time!;5.0;The meal, service and ambiance made this an excellent evening. Learned a lot about caviar and all in English!;mai-18;Boutary
2;Sophisticated food In st Germain de pres;5.0;You arrive into unassuming dining room and are transported into a gastronomic adventure with twists and turns that make for a exciting culinary treat. 5 course prix fixe dinner and The talented kitchen staff coax flavors out of each of the fine dishes you don’t always expect. A prime example is the basil ice cream. Polished service add to a memorable experience. good quality ingredients cooked with passion are a hallmark.;mai-18;Boutary
2;excellent dinner;5.0;"Very attentive staff, an impressive and innovative tasting menu (""pomme de terre au caviar"" was a highlight) with a fine choice of matching wines. We had a brilliant evening that my tastebuds will remember. Bravo et merci.";avr-18;Boutary
2;Lovely find in Paris!;5.0;Had an amazing meal with friends and the staff and owner were extremely knowledgeable about caviar and wine. Definitely a must on your next visit to Paris.;avr-18;Boutary
2;Wonderful service, good caviar, great for gluten-free;5.0;Frederic and the restaurant staff couldn't have been nicer, welcoming our family and explaining everything on the menu. My daughter, usually a very picky eater, loved the caviar (okay, maybe that's the definition of picky!) and my wife, who always has to eat gluten-free, found the strawberry dessert especially delicious. For a lovely dinner in Paris, try Boutary!;mai-18;Boutary
2;Perfect dinner;5.0;When I was searching Trip Advisor for the best place to have a special dinner on my last night in Paris I found the Boutary. This turned out to be an excellent choice. I had a great time: Friendly service, excellent food and wine and nice neighbors.Service: Very friendly, good English explanations of food and wineAtmosphere: I was sitting in the back room. It has a very interesting lightning concept and comfortable chairsFood: I had the 5-course surprise menu with the recommended wine. Everything was delicious.I can highly recommend the Boutary for a special or romantic dinner. I will definitely come back the next time I am in Paris.;mai-18;Boutary
2;Excellent, knowledgable staff, delicious;4.0;Excellent. There is an overarching theme on caviar with the restaurant owning their own sturgeon farm. The staff are passionate, friendly and very knowledgeable and the food was well presented. Only marked down to four stars as its not a restaurant for those requiring a substantive menu to choose from.;avr-18;Boutary
2;paris trip;4.0;Great location. Wonderful ambience. dishes a little uneven. It is a caviar centric restaurant. We did not order the caviar tasting for better or worse.;avr-18;Boutary
2;Highlight of Paris;5.0;This was by far and away the best dining experience my husband and I had on our first trip to Paris. The service was incredibly hospitable and very nice. The dining room is cozy and intimate and every employee that touched our table was lovely and informative about the menu. Although we prefer “traditional” caviar service (blinis, Creme fraiche, capers etc) we thoroughly enjoyed the caviar inspired tasting menu with the Beluga caviar to start. I can’t thank the staff enough for how sweet and welcoming they were to us. I speak limited French but it was not an issue and we were made to feel comfortable from start to finish. I wish we had more time to go back to explore other menu options, but as the French say “c’est la vie!” Oh, the potato caviar dish (second course) was AMAZING. Thank you again Boutary. we truly appreciate your hospitality!;mai-18;Boutary
2;Splendid Restaurant;5.0;Very serene atmosphere and we enjoyed every bit of it. Recommend definitely and will come back again.;mai-18;Boutary
2;Wonderful Service and Food;5.0;We really enjoyed the tasting menu and caviar here and the service was very friendly. They took the time to chat about everything on the menu and the caviar process, we felt like we learned so much as well!;avr-18;Boutary
2;Excellent;5.0;Excellent food and service - try the caviar if it's your first time (albeit not an absolute must).We were personally contacted by the manager yesterday to inquire about the quality of our meal further to a previous comment about food on that night. I can therefore vouch for the quality of the pork dish I had :-)Regards to the chef.;avr-18;Boutary
2;Quirky and Enjoyable;4.0;A very enjoyable experience. The decor is very striking and the staff are very attentive and engaging. The food was very different. We had the tasting dinner to experience the restaurant.I thought the last dish although very tasty and well presented was out of place and overpower the experience (my thoughts). The dish itself looked good, the meat was very tough although cooked properly the flavours strong. It was on the back of mostly seafood subtle flavours. Still well worth the experience;avr-18;Boutary
2;FOOD POISONING;1.0;My husband and I ate there last night and spent 255 euros on what we thought was going to be a way to celebrate 9ur last night in Paris. We never would have thought that we would ever get this sick from a place with such high reviews. We got the ravioli soup and small caviar to start. Both were great. The service was fantastic. Then we both got the pork for our main dish and that was the issue. I noticed the pork for as undercooked but I assumed that was how the dish was supposed to be cooked. (I am terrible in the kitchen so I trusted the pros here.) Fast forward to 24 hours later, my husband and I have been extremely sick all day and had to catch a flight to Barcelona. If he doesn't get better soon we will be at the hospital from this place. Do. Not. Eat. Here.;avr-18;Boutary
2;Not too impressed!!!!;2.0;Well i thought that would be a caviar festival but portions where pretty small and staff was bit snobbish :(. INCREASE THE PORTIONS !!!!;mars-18;Boutary
2;Fantastic caviar. fantastic 'company';5.0;My wife and I went to the Boutary on the first night of our honeymoon. It was a mini-moon so we were very selective on which restaurants to try while in Paris, and chose the Boutary based on their reviews on tripadvisor and the beautiful dishes on their website. Also we quite fancied trying caviar (properly this time!). We ended up eating too big of a lunch and only had room for caviar.... the caviar tasting was fantastic. Well priced and extraordinary caviar. The decor, service, wine & champagne were all great that we decided to come back again the following night for the full tasting menu. On arrival the staff remembered us and were very personable - we felt like family. They really made our time at the restaurant over both nights very special. As for the tasting menu - the food was good, but not incredible. The desserts were very light and wonderfully non-sweet which were the perfect enders to the meal. However the best experience still in our book was the caviar - a must try!;mars-18;Boutary
2;Delightful;5.0;My husband and I did not want to miss out on a lovely culinary experience even though we were traveling with our girls, so we brought the kids (ages 10 and 12). The couple next to us looked on wearily when we arrived, but at the end of the night commended the kids on their wonderful behavior. The service was outstanding, and the children were treated exceedingly well. My husband and I wanted the tasting menu, but they prefer that everyone at the table get the prix fixe menu. Since two of our diners were children, we weren't sure how that would go. They recommended that the kids share a tasting menu, which was PERFECT. Price-wise, it was similar to if they both ordered an entree off of the a la carte menu, and they were able to try everything. Our menu consisted of a smoked meat starter (kids liked), caviar and potato appetizer (one child LOVED and the other child wouldn't try, parents LOVED), fish entree (kids didn't love, parents did), steak entree (everyone could not get enough) and two different desserts that were amazing. The adults also did the wine pairing, which is recommended as all of the wines were amazing. Not inexpensive, but well worth it if you plan to do one nice meal while in Paris. The ambiance is delightful and neighborhood is very quaint.;avr-18;Boutary
2;It was an excellent evening.;5.0;I enjoy eating out. We often go to a restaurant with my parents. It usually happens at weekend or Friday evenings, when everybody is free from work and studies. If you are a gourmand, I can recommend you the French restaurant, located in the historic cellar, with elements of antique design and quite interesting cuisine.;sept-17;Boutary
2;Fantastic fine dining experience;5.0;We went to Boutary for lunch, and enjoyed their daily prix fixe menu tremendously. Very high quality dishes in a restaurant with history in the Saint Germain des Prés neighborhood in Paris. Love that the chef has an international background!;avr-18;Boutary
2;Best restaurant visit of our trip to Paris!;5.0;My husband and I had the set-menu for lunch with the caviar tasting. The caviar tasting was amazing which came with a brief history lesson from our server and the three courses were amazing for lunch! The main, which was a scallop risotto with lobster froth, was by far the best course I had while visiting Paris. Our server was classy, friendly and personable--also the best service we received throughout our trip. As we went during the week the overall atmosphere had more of a business lunch feel to it, perhaps this would be different on the weekends. The décor is very classy. I would highly recommend treating yourself to an amazing experience here!;mars-18;Boutary
2;Definitely better than some Michelin star restaurants!!!;5.0;Saw the good reviews and as such, decided to give this restaurant a try. Am Glad I did. Service is good and not intrusive. Good selection of wines of course but the food is really good.I tried the tasting menu and The beluga caviar is a good way to start...large lovely caviar, a hint of sweetness which burst into full flavour....First course, smoked veal, with Uni, green and red Apple, pickled. Amazing mixing of taste and flavours...2nd course was just simply amazing....smoked steamed potato with caviar and cream...caviar full of flavour of the sea..salty, sweet potato all mixed together to give an amazing experience.Then came the Monk fish cheek, poached in butter, youghurt , anchovy sauce and clams with green asparagus... heavenly....Finally, Beef from Spain...dry aged ...parsnip purée and spinach...what a way to end the journey....;avr-18;Boutary
2;Excellent;5.0;Excellent service. Nice atmosphere.  Food so delicious and extraordinary.  Amazing desserts.  Highly recommend.;avr-18;Boutary
2;Romantic. Great Value for Money.;5.0;I went here on a weekend away with my SO. It is a beautiful, small, cosy and romantic venue. The staff were absolutely delightful and explained each dish on the tasting menu really well. They looked after us really well. But the food was the STAR. Highly recommend getting the tasting menu + caviar. It is excellent and well worth the money. The food is luxurious and tasty.;déc-17;Boutary
2;A lovely seasonal lunch with fantastic service;5.0;Everything was delicious. We weren’t sure about taking our teens here but it turned out to be a perfect French fancy lunch. Our son especially loved the potatoes with caviar. The staff was extremely helpful and welcoming.;mars-18;Boutary
2;Thumbs up!;5.0;Excellent food, excellent service. Restaurant which is really worth of visiting. We took signature menu with Beluga caviar.;mars-18;Boutary
2;Boutary Visit on Easter Saturday;5.0;Fantastic dining experience in a lovely atmosphere. Picked the menu degustation with the accompanying wines and enjoyed it from start to end. Aside the fantastic food and rhe elegant wines, the service was top notch.;avr-18;Boutary
2;Great;4.0;We came to Boutary witch specializes in caviar dishes for a mid week lunch. My wife had the daily special and I ordered the caviar potatoes and the lamb witch they did not have and was substituted by Guinness hen, the food and service were excellent but the caviar made for an expensive lunch.;mars-18;Boutary
2;Amazing!;5.0;We had a lunch-menu. 3 courses. It was absolutely delicious. The service was superb. The decor in the back of the restaurant was a bit Dark and ‘strange’, but it could not ruin the very, very positive experience.;mars-18;Boutary
2;Wonderful experience;5.0;We have chosen the restaurant because of the good reviews on tripadvisor – and, wow, we have not been disappointed! It was an excellent meal („menu surprise“) with outstanding tastes. It was a piece of art like we had before inthe museums of monet at renoir: a wonderful, modern cooking with extraorinary combination of tastes. The service has been impecable, friendly and personal.Thanks for the great evening! We will come again next time we are in Paris!;mars-18;Boutary
2;Paris dinner;5.0;Very lucky to come this restaurant, the service is very good n can speak fluent English. Also introduce the set menu is so good taste Sure will come back with my family .;mars-18;Boutary
2;Excellent wedding anniversary dinner;5.0;Booked this restaurant long time ago for our wedding anniversary dinner. From the caviar introduction, the tasting menu, the wine pairing & the excellent service from our servers, they all come up to one conclusion:This restaurant is truly one of the best in the world, well done!!!Hopefully we can go back again for more!;mars-18;Boutary
2;Great little restaurant;4.0;we had the pre fixe menu without the extra caviar menu. This restaurant's specialty is caviar. They were very attentive and explained each dish. We had one person with a nut allergy and upon arrival they let us know that only one dessert dish had nuts. They also asked which person on our table had the allergy. During dessert, they rechecked the dessert to make sure it wasn't the nut dessert. Some interesting dishes.;mars-18;Boutary
2;Delicious dining;5.0;Lovely dinner, excellent service, stark atmosphere. The food and wine pairing were perfectly crafted and presented.;mars-18;Boutary
2;awesome;5.0;caviar is their specialty. The waiter is very patient and knowledgable. The interior decor is very modern and special. I had a great time!;mars-18;Boutary
2;Caviar and much more;5.0;On our last trip to Paris, we made this place one of our two 'big night' dinners and were very happy with our choice. I had asked in advance for a cozy spot conducive to quiet conversation with my slightly challenged hearing and we were escorted to one of the two tables in the red niche (see the gallery on their website). The decor in rest of the place is a joy behold (there are no 'bad' seats here) but this was the right choice for us that night and we were thankful for the thought that went into it. Our prix fixe menu was great from start to finish. The caviar, for which the place is justly famous, was wonderfully served in a small bowl atop a tower of potatoes that had been smoked over an aromatic wood, all surrounded by an exquisite dollop of cream sauce--it was just tremendous! Other dishes, though, from fresh fish to delicious foie gras, were prepared with equal creativity and perfectly done. Our desserts were both light and flavorful. Our very knowledgeable servers, Miguel and Angel, guided us through the menu and accompanying wine choices expertly with contagious good humor. Fine dining too often lacks the element of fun in favor of high seriousness. For us that night, Boutary was a pleasant departure from that rule. The dining was indeed fine and fun! There are so many good choices to eat in Paris, even within the St. Germain area alone, but I'll pay Boutary the highest compliment I can think of in such a competitive dining environment--we'll be back!;janv-18;Boutary
2;Treat Yo' SELF!!!!;5.0;"As a solo traveler, I actually did consider eating every meal as a crepe. As soon as I told my roommates back home they said, ""Dash, you should eat at least one fancy dinner somewhere. Something you'll remember."" You know what, they were right! I had enough cash to go anywhere I wanted, so I just Googled 'Fancy restaurants' and Boutary popped up. I immediately booked the next available spot on the following evening. I just needed a place that was fancy but still allowed me to wear the clothes I packed because I was NOT about to go through the journey of buying fancy clothes and packing them into my over-stuffed suitcase. Thankfully I had some nice clothes to look presentable in for evenings.When I first arrived, I wasn't sure if this was a place for me. The atmosphere was very romantic and intimate. I sorely wished I had someone I could have eaten with. Even though I was only in Europe for 10 days, I was just trying to escape America for a bit and I work at a non-profit opening myself up to other people's problems to assist them public benefits, I should be able to enjoy a nice meal for myself! I actually didn't know that this was a caviar house, and I've never had caviar. Oh well. Surprise me! If I had any allergies, France has me covered and I didn't suspect any of that.I was a bumbling fool coming in. I am not used to anything fancy. I just didn't want to make any faux pas and my normal faculties were lost to me. I didn't sit on the side of the table they offered me, I couldn't get my wallet out of my coat so I didn't give it to them. Do I talk to other people? Should I? Oh, God, I just don't want to be creepy! You know what? Who cares! I'm here to enjoy myself because I deserve it (although secretly I felt super guilty because how could I justify all of this extravagance spent on myself alone?). The staff put me at ease and were very kind and courteous to me as I fumbled through some decades-old French. Who are we kidding ourselves? We're going to do this in English and we're going to make this work! Totally cool, they all speak English.I decided upon doing the tasting menu with wine pairing. The staff was very knowledgeable and professional. Each platter was just exquisite. The beef, languistine, potato, caviar, dessert! Oh my God, dessert!!! I felt like Belle in Beauty and Beast just waiting for the next expertly crafted plate to be brought over with just the perfect wine pairing. What did I do to deserve this? I don't know, but these wine glasses and sparkling water just keep flowing and my unrefined palate is in a coma. What did I just put in me? Why do I still feel guilty about this? Is this because I've been conditioned to shun self-care and basic human service to accept sub-par conditions in the United States? Probably. By the end, I didn't care that I was alone. I DID have an unforgettable experience. I DID step completely out of my comfort zone and I'm better for it! I shouldn't feel guilty about my own self-care, especially on vacation. If you're on the fence, treat yo' self!!! And Boutary will CERTAINLY ensure that you will!!! Thanks, Boutary!!!";mars-18;Boutary
2;Best of Paris - can I give 6 stars???;5.0;My wife and I celebrated our 20 year anniversary in Paris, and selected Boutary for our coup de grace dining experience based on Trip Advisor reviews. This was certainly among the top 5 dining experiences of my life, and Boutary is certainly deserving of a Michelin star. What can I say, caviar tasting, exquisite langoustine and seared foie gras with tangerine, lobster stock reduction, and wonderfully prepared desserts. The detailed, professional, and warm service made the experience unforgettable. My wife mentioned how much she adores foie gras, and the chef sent out an extra small plate as his gift to us as we were enjoying our main course. We will return to Boutary every time we visit Paris and refer it to anyone we know who visits. We thank Boutary and their entire staff for making our evening unforgettable!;mars-18;Boutary
2;Found excellent French Restaurant!;5.0;This was the first French restaurant in Paris that we truly enjoyed after 4-5 visits. Food was excellent and service was impeccable.;mars-18;Boutary
2;Most amazing experience;5.0;We ordered the 4 course dinner pre-fixe menu. Every dish was absolutely amazing. We couldn’t wait to try the next one. I don’t always enjoy French food but boutary food was amazing. The beluga caviar was also excellent. The service was just as amazing. Frederic, the caviar expert, was especially impressive. Highly recommend this restaurant in every way.;mars-18;Boutary
2;Perfect;5.0;A very nice discovery during a professional trip to Paris. Perfect French service. The food is delicious, I highly recommend.;mars-18;Boutary
2;A Food Odyssey;5.0;ATTENTION ALL FOODIES!! I am so hooked on trying new foods! My husband and I experienced an INCREDIBLE restaurant in Paris! The owner of the restaurant has a caviar farm in Bulgaria and shared his vision for his restaurant(s). We told the owner and server to bring us the “chef’s inspirations”. We started with our first lesson on caviar paired with champagne. Totally changed my whole perception of caviar! Smooth, creamy, buttery, mild. Then on to the next taste- thinly sliced celery carpaccio, green apples infused with hibiscus (oh what heaven) as well as thin sticks of green apple and thin sliced smoked beef with sea urchin. What a marriage of tastes and texture! Next? A serving of potato’s with a more mature caviar and lemongrass crème. While the tastes exploded with each new plate, I wondered how the next one could change my world. Next? Norwegian lobster served with a bisque and lobster sauce, softened beets, and lightly seared fois gras. So melt in your mouth! More? Of course! Aged beef with horseradish/crème/ and lime sauce , parsnip purée, lightly steamed spinach with garlic. Fantastic! On to dessert- a mandarine cream with mandarine pulp, a nutty crumbly base, crowned with melted then hardened transparent sugar. Wow! Dessert two? Pistachio crumble topped with a light citrus meranguine and white chocolate discs, small clusters of pink grapefruit pulp and a raspberry sorbet. Upon the completion of the meal, the owner offered us a small digestif. We again deferred to his knowledge. For My husband, he brought a smoked vodka and for me, rhubarb vodka. Again Wow!!!! We look forward to going back at least 4 or 5 more times before the end of summer! (We must get better at photographing our meals!);mars-18;Boutary
2;Cracking place to have lunch...;5.0;Great little restaurant offering a cosy environment in which to enjoy expert and friendly service that provides a perfect tour through the world of caviar. Unlike many restaurants in Paris, the tables are well spaced out and the ambience is perfect for good food and convivial conversation. Good value for money, too - not often said of caviar restaurants! Highly recommended.;févr-18;Boutary
2;A real gem!;5.0;Had a wonderful evening at Boutary. Our daughter selected this restaurant and I was really wondering if it would live up to the amazing reviews. Well, it did! Took the menu cart blanche and had the waiter to suggest a wine that would go with it. Both choices were impeccable, as was the service throughout the evening. Everybody in our party of four was truly impressed! Prices are fair for the quality of the food served.;févr-18;Boutary
2;Excellent service, delicious tasting menu;5.0;Always a bit sceptic when seeing a non-Michelin starred restaurant this high up on TripAdvisor, but after having had dinner there I can look back with fondness of a place where the service is as excellent and the dishes are delicious. Not a two/three star yet, but that first star can't be too far on the horizon! A great evening for two, and we'll definitely be back for another tasting menu.;févr-18;Boutary
2;Amazing experience;5.0;Been there for a business meal. Great location, delicious food and amazing service. Definitely a great place to have a classy dinner while in Paris.;janv-18;Boutary
2;Excellent — deserves Michelin Star;5.0;Try the tasting menu. One of the top meals I’ve had, and I’ve been lucky enough to visit many great restaurants around the world! While it’s hard to call anything in this price range a bargain, the price is fair for the high quality. The beef fillet steak, sea urchin, and prawns were especially tasty. My girlfriend doesn’t normally eat beef but it was so tasty she couldn’t resist. Hope to come back next time I’m in Paris!;févr-18;Boutary
2;Great signature menu;5.0;Excellent service and food. If you are looking for a  fine dining  experience in paris you won't be disappointed;févr-18;Boutary
2;The Perfect Meal on Valentines Day;5.0;Me and my girlfriend booked a table here on Valentines Day for dinner as the show piece to our trip and they certainly did not let us down. I cannot stress how perfect this meal and service was. To start the atmosphere is wonderful and thanks to the red decor it was also very appropriate on this particular day. They have had it designed by artist Ann Grim with each area unique and colourful with its own charm. We were made to feel very welcome by Charles (owner & caviar expert) and our waiter Fred who looked after us impeccably. We knew nothing about caviar prior to eating here and they ran us through the basics with books to compare varieties. It was a set menu this evening of 5 courses which we opted to go for with the paired wines and champagne. Two of the course including the house special came with caviar to complement, and I also got to try sea urchins for the first time which added to this unique experience. I can't decide which dish was my favourite, each course continued to win me over including some stunning frois gras which i'm normally quite hesitant to eat given the choice. The wines were all perfectly suited to each course and at the end they even took us up to meet chef Jay due to our incessant enthusiasm over the meal. On our departure they even gifted my lady a single red rose, nice touch. Hands down the best meal we have ever had.;févr-18;Boutary
2;Wonderful and expensive caviar. But the rest is ordinary.;3.0;Very expensive restaurant, so it has to be worth it. Knowledgable staff on caviar and an extensive menu, so if you are a caviar fan with the money, OK, go for it. But the rest of the menu (including their signature dish of potatoes with the caviar) is a disappointment when the price is concerned. Nothing tastes bad, but when yu remember the price tag, not a single dish is worth it. Disappointment.;févr-18;Boutary
2;Little Gem in St Germain;5.0;We loved this place from the warm yet relaxed atmosphere, the professional staff to the crisp and fresh wines to the amazing flavors created by a master chef. I had the chefs menu, and it was Michelin quality. The presentation, the flavors and the use of fresh ingredients makes Boutary a MUST if you get to the 6th. Langoustines and foie gras? Yes...and the chocolate desert was crazy good as well. Frederic was a fantastic host and gave us some suggestions which were appreciated. Hope they get their star 2019....;févr-18;Boutary
2;Wonderful and pleasant experience;5.0;Wonderful food and Wine at fair prices. Nice and competent staff. Interesting and cosy decorations and interieur. This was our second visit and definately not the last.;févr-18;Boutary
2;Little gem;5.0;Fun interior design, delicious food, enthusiastic and charming staff. My wife and I had the tasting menu and paired wine which was uniformly strong with some great dishes. Relaxed atmosphere. Unpretentious, feel you could dress up or down depending on how you feel but you’ll get very good food and a big welcome.;févr-18;Boutary
2;Pretty good;3.0;Personally did not really like the food. Most of the stuff was quite salty and was quite expensive. The waiters were amazingly nice and welcoming.;févr-18;Boutary
2;Amazing! Must go!;5.0;I was traveling alone in Paris and decided to have one amazing meal. I could not have picked better. I did the 5 course chef tasting menu with wine pairings. Every single thing was incredible. Waiter service was also so wonderful, they took excellent care of me. I cannot recommend high enough!;févr-18;Boutary
2;We Will Be Back;5.0;Enjoyed a perfect evening at Boutary. Atmosphere is casual, quaint and artsy. Service was outstanding and food was high quality and extraordinary. Great wine list. A perfect evening.;févr-18;Boutary
2;Dinner for two splendid;5.0;I organized my partner's birthday dinner: they were very good and everything was perfect!Really delicious cuisine and very nice locationTo try!;févr-18;Boutary
2;Excellent and special;5.0;A lovely small restaurant with an incredibly sophisticated menu - starting with Beluga caviar and ending with the most delicious tangerine desert I’ve ever had. Outstanding wine list. Service is exceptional - the staff are super professional, know their stuff, and are exactly as friendly as you would expect at a 5-star restaurant. We chose the tasting menu and got a nice range of some outstanding culinary delights.;févr-18;Boutary
2;Always friendly, always superb!;5.0;This is my favourite restaurant in Paris at the moment. I go to France 3, 4 times a year for business and have kept going back to Boutary every time I was in town recently. The food is cooked to perfection and the presentation is very pretty. Caviar tasting is highly recommended. I’ve tried it several times and in different months and never known there are so many subtle but different tastes and varieties in caviars! The service is always great and the staff is friendly and knowledgeable in what they are serving. I particularly enjoy talking to the manager. He is very professional and so welcoming. I can’t wait to go back next time I am in Paris!;janv-18;Boutary
2;Incredible!;5.0;My wife booked this restaurant for our last day in Paris and all we expected was another nice eveningBut my words are poor to express our delight for the time we spent at BoutaryWonderful food, friendly athmosphere, exellent stuff and the best caviar I ever tasted and all this at an amazingly afordable price!We were hoping to miss our flight because of the snow the other day and ...we didn't but now we have one more reason to visit Pais!;févr-18;Boutary
2;A gastronomic delight!;5.0;Tried the 5 course tasting menu with paired wines - absolutely delicious! The waiter was charming and informative - very good service.;févr-18;Boutary
2;Caviar Delight;5.0;We cannot rate this experience highly enough. We will recommend it to all of our friends. Great wine, great food, great service, exceptional caviar.;févr-18;Boutary
2;wonderful venue;5.0;Had an amazing dinner with stunning food and a unique caviar tasting conducted by the owner, Charles, who turns out to be quite an expert in these fine pearls. Caviar can be added to a few of the dishes on the everyday menu and there's a few signature dishes worth trying, like Potato & Caviar. Charles happily shared his knowledge and expertise which lifted the experience quite a bit. The service was very pleasant and our waiter was attentive yet discreet allowing us to talk without interrupting too much. From a food point of view I was very surprised about the compositions and the quality of ingredients in generel throughout the evening. I feel many Paris venues seem to be slightly overrated when it comes to the food - I know it's a brutal thing to say - however compared to many restaurants in capitals of the nordic region I've had many dissapointing meals in Paris. Boutary far from disappoints and I will be back for sure.Thank you for an epic feast.;janv-18;Boutary
2;Perfect food & wonderful service!;5.0;I visited this last Saturday and it was the perfect romantic night, my partner & I were only in Paris for 24 hours & we were so glad to have chosen this place! The caviar was delicious, the salmon starter divine - no dish here disappointed. I was also SO impressed with the service, our waiter (sorry I’m not sure of his name) was just brilliant, so attentive, friendly and knowledgeable - of course his English was excellent but he could also speak Japanese to my partner! Overall a wonderful night & will definitely return to Boutary when I’m next in Paris!;janv-18;Boutary
2;Superb !;5.0;I recently had a wonderful experience here at Boutary! The food was absolutely delicious and the staff went above and beyond to ensure we had a terrific experience. I have a few eating restrictions that I adhere to, such as eating gluten free and having a mostly vegetarian diet. The maitre D, Fréd, was very gracious in handling my many request and made sure that I would get the full dinning experience, which was refreshing and inviting since many restaurants in Paris seem to dislike hearing about food allergies or diet restrictions.;janv-18;Boutary
2;Wonderful!;5.0;Delicious dinner. We were walking by the Boutary with my wife, and were lucky to get a table for just few minutes a wait. We had the tasting menu with the recommened wines, and it was wonderful. The staff was also very warm and welcoming, aswell as they were professionals. Thank you very much!;janv-18;Boutary
2;Exquisite refined French cuisine for a reasonable price;5.0;"Exquisite food, friendly service. We loved the tasting menu ""Menu dégustation"" which allows you to taste several different dishes. Every mouthful was delicate and surprising. The presentation of each dish was worthy of a Michelin-starred restaurant. Amazing. If you love caviar, this is a fantastic find. And even if you don't like caviar, there are many other delicious specialties, fish, chicken and beef. Ideal for a romantic or business dinner. The wines are carefully selected to go perfectly with the food. I live in Paris, so I know lots of other restaurants to compare with, and I'm pretty picky. I can definitely recommend Boutary with NO hesitation.";janv-18;Boutary
2;A pearl in St. Germain;5.0;We discovered this nice restaurant near our hotel. Luckily there was one table left, so it's worth wile a reservation. We had a 5- course menu and it was just fantastic with the wine package. You had no feeling that you had overeated, just enjoying the different plates. The staff was also very nice . Just a Place to recommend. Extra points for the caviar degustation.;janv-18;Boutary
2;Worth a visit;5.0;We had the signature menu which was 5 courses and a selection of 3 glasses of wine and added champagne and dessert wine. All the wines were very nicely balanced to the food and the waiters/sommelier were all very serviceminded and kind which contributed to a genuine nice atmosphere. If you’re looking for a romantic dinner in Paris and have 300 euro to spend, we strongly recommend this restaurant! Don’t miss out on the cocktail bar next door!;janv-18;Boutary
2;Wonderful Evening!;5.0;I had reserved for New Year's Eve and had to cancel, but my companion and I happened to find ourselves walking by at about 11 a.m. the day before, the door open. We walked in and ended up meeting the young chef and the manager. They were lovely, but sad to tell us they were completely booked that night. they promised to let us know if something freed up and the did. What a gift! Starting with a tasting of the greatest vodka I've ever had (Chase Special Edition Oak Smoked), continuing through the amuse bouche, on through a 5-course tasting menu, paired with lovely and unusual wines, capped by an extraordinary dessert, it was one of my most memorable meals in many years. Up to the minute cooking, wonderful ingredients impeccably handled, serious talent! If you can, don't miss.;déc-17;Boutary
2;Simply amazing!;5.0;Pricey place but really good. The chef is half Japanese-half Korean so there is a ton of Asian influence in the cuisine here. Each course was paired with high end Bordeaux wines and we finished the entire meal off with a Polish flavored vodka. Honestly the pictures don't do the food justice. So many quality ingredients and such well composed meals. I was in awe. It's almost sacrilegious that this place doesn't have a Michelin star. Whatever the reason it is, it can't be the food. The decor was interesting. Most of the lighting was in the walls and the red backdrop of the restaurant gave it a pretty unique feeling. This place has a Russian name, and an Asian chef who is preparing French food! Whodathunk?Not so humbly submitted,Michael C.;avr-17;Boutary
2;They will get the star for 2 reasons;5.0;1) The signature dish is outstanding, I have had many dishes in 3 stars that did not meet this taste quality.2) They have an incredibly nice & pleasant service;déc-17;Boutary
2;Very Disappointing Experience;1.0;I made my reservation with several months in advance to take my wife and daughters for what was supposed to be a special dinner. A few days before the date for the dinner I received an email requesting a confirmation, which I did and latter I received a second email reconfirming my reservation.Today December 30th I arrived at the restaurant and was informed that my reservation was cancelled, I never received a cancelation e-mail, and I never cancelled my reservation, as I said before I reconfirmed a few days before, and even though I presented the email with the confirmation, the manager did not give us a table or any other option/solution.Finally I was left in Paris on December the 30th at 8 pm with no option for dinner in one of the most busy nights in the city.This is UNACCEPTABLE at a restaurant that is supposed to be recommended by the Michelin guide.;déc-17;Boutary
2;Nice meal;4.0;Overall a very nice meal.We enjoyed the degustation menu which was just the right size for us.Wine was good, but not very generous servings.Overall the meal for 2 was $300.;déc-17;Boutary
2;A fantastic anniversary dinner;5.0;Frederic and his team were superb. very friendly but also knowledgeable. We chose the tasting menu with the premium wine pairing and every dish was outstanding. I would highly recommend this restaurant for a celebratory dinner.;déc-17;Boutary
2;Excellent diner, good ambiance and very kind staff;4.0;Our first and best diner in Paris during our 4 day trip. We had the signaturen menu, 5 courses plus wine arrangement. Food quality was perfect. Personnel were very nice, they all have a good understanding of the English language. They also have a good knowledge of the food and wine they served. It is not a big restaurant which is good for the ambiance.;déc-17;Boutary
2;Paris for Lunch;5.0;A very welcoming, thoroughly rewarding experience. The caviar is fabulous and competitively priced, the cooking was sympathetically prepared and of a very high standard, the service was exemplary - in short the whole experience was a delight,;déc-17;Boutary
2;Lovely meal;5.0;We were lucky to get in without a reservation. The staff are super friendly and very efficient. The restaurant specializes in Caviar, but we had a lovely meal without the caviar. Their lunch special is €29 for two courses. We had an eel and goats cheese veloute for starters and the lamb shank for mains, both of which were lovely.;déc-17;Boutary
2;Top draw;5.0;Arrived with a little trepidation as one does in Paris with so many amazing restaurants. The welcome was friendly and welcoming without feeling pressured or overwhelming whatsoever. Maitre d and staff have a very good thing going. Really lovely people with a great attitude and nothing more than making the customer feel welcome and happy. Food was superb. Actually as good as we’ve had. Fine dining but not overly fussy. Really tasty and thoughtful. We had the taster mane which was sublime from start to finish. We didn’t have too much caviar (but had some) as it’s not our bag but it’s their speciality and I don’t doubt the quality judging by the rest of the fare. Wonderful night and we will go back next time in Paris some time soon. Compliments to the chef, manager one and all.;déc-17;Boutary
2;PLEASANT UNEXPECTED;5.0;it was a super experience, the tasting menu full of surprises and very elaborated, service impecable;déc-17;Boutary
2;Red, white, and romantic;5.0;If you want a well balanced degustacion in an intimate quiet setting, this is the place for you. Spartan for those looking for baroque, sublime for those looking for suburb food and service. We visit a lot of restaurants in Paris each trip and this one is amongst the best.;déc-17;Boutary
2;Wonderful;5.0;When you go have the taster’s menu from the chef. It was both terrific and educational. Service was superb.;déc-17;Boutary
2;Great restaurant!!!!;5.0;I would highly recommend this restaurant. The food was excellent from preparation to presentation, perfectly served. The service was very good all courses well explained. The restaurant itself has a fine warm atmosphere. We had our x-mas dinner with 12 guests and the chef nailed it perfectly. That was memorable.;déc-17;Boutary
2;Evening meal.;5.0;Fantastic food. Friendly and helpful staff. Had the signature five course menu for €79. Would recommend it.;déc-17;Boutary
2;Dinner;5.0;The food and staff was stupendous. Each meal was delivered with great attention to detail and the atmosphere was just what we anticipated for our evening.;déc-17;Boutary
2;Great food and great service.;5.0;The food was very good. all dishes were tasty and well made. Service was surprisingly friendly but professional. The food is not revolutionary and outstanding but rather well made with good gourmet tastes.;déc-17;Boutary
2;Amazing experience;4.0;We decided to treat ourselves to a special meal out while in Paris for a long weekend and we weren't disappointed by the Boutary.3 of our party of 4 had the taster menu, two with accompanying wines & caviar.The food was exceptionally good, each course infused great flavours, were presented beautifully & the waiters were outstanding giving great over views of how each course was cooked, where the produce was from etc.The wine was also outstaning, the ladies in the group had 2 bottles of white while the men had an extra bottle of the red after the tasting wines had been drunk!There are a couple of reasons I didn't provide a rating of 5 -1 - although the menu does specify 3 glasses with the taster menu, in pretty much every other restraint I've dined in with a similar taster menu they have generally given small top ups with the wine (within reason of course). here , you get only 3 glasses.2 - we were sat in front of the door and every time it opened there was a horrible freezing draught & this happened many times during the evening.3 - There were 3 fish dishes & only 1 meat. It would have been nice to have had 2 meat & 2 fish.The restraint is not cheap & the food really was exceptional along with the service. However, while spending 500 euros on a meal between 4 people the points above unfortunately meant I couldn't award a rating of 5.My advice to anyone going would be to ask for a table not in front of the door and not to go for the paired wines (although they did compliment the meals well).;déc-17;Boutary
2;An excellent experience;5.0;A wonderful restaurant with an outstanding service being effecient and friendly. the food was of top class with an extra twist in every plate!!;nov-17;Boutary
2;Definitely worth a visit;5.0;We opted for the Degustation menu and found the food really interesting without being pretentious. We felt there was somewhat of a Japanese influence (which we loved), every dish was a surprise of beautifully balanced, absolutely fresh ingredients. We chose the Premium wine pairing which was also excellent introducing unknown (to us) wines that perfectly complemented the dishes. Contemporary world-class food at its best. The staff were friendly, helpful, multilingual and also not pretentious. We had a delightfully relaxed evening and felt previous reviewers who gave this restaurant a high rating were on the mark.;nov-17;Boutary
2;Phenomenal;5.0;Exceptional Food and great service... truly an amazing experience. Edgy but cozy restaurant and great value for what you pay.Kudos to the Boutary team...one of the best meals we had in Paris.;mai-17;Boutary
2;Nice Experience;4.0;I went with my wife for a dinner at this nice restaurant in Saint Germain. Reception and service were very nice and attentive but the ambiance could be more animated. Food was very good: we took the menu signature with wine pairing and the plates were really delicious. The wine pairing was also very good, wine and food combining for a perfect match. For us, the dessert was a little bit disappointing, especially the one with pineapple. A little bit overpriced but, overall, a very nice experience - I recommend.;nov-17;Boutary
2;tasty and delicious !;5.0;Love the atmosphere, nice service, friendly waiters.. corn salad is very unique and tasty. patatas pravas and spicy meat are delicious as well.. ❤️;nov-17;Boutary
2;Very very good;5.0;We both had the excellent menu signature with the premium wine pairing. Was very very good. The food itself was exquisite and had a wide range of flavours. Presentation was very good as well. Wine choices were well chosen and with a little bit of surprise added in. I actually thought this was excellent value.;oct-17;Boutary
2;Very nice serving;5.0;They got really nice serving but food is delicious too. The staff is very friendly and professional too.;sept-17;Boutary
2;Art;5.0;Food in this restaurant is art on plate, the serving is so nice and original. But the taste of it is delicious too. I recommend.;juil-17;Boutary
2;Legit fancy, impeccable service, and outstanding fare.;5.0;My last meal in Paris on my recent vacation was to be a fancy one. The highest rated on TripAdvisor with reservations available was the 7th, Boutary.The way the staff treated me, I felt like John Wick at the Continental. They also didn't care that I was dressed in my Blade Runner trench coat and hobo gloves.The main course was one of the best meals I’d ever eaten. When you pay a hundred bucks for a meal, you hope that you’re not getting ripped off with fake-fancy, underwhelming food. Boutary is absolutely not screwing around. The filet mignon was cooked to absolute perfection. It was my first time trying caviar, and it was interesting, to say the least. I never thought I would have the experience licking a small spoonful of salty fish eggs off the back of my hand, but it was interesting, to say the least. The server was not lying about their unique taste lingering.The best part, however, was the fact that they gladly accommodated the fact that I no longer drink, and happily substituted the liqour in the sorbet desert for something else. Seriously, that really meant a lot to me.If you are looking for fine dining in Paris, go to Boutary. You won't regret it. Safe to say, it's earned it's rank.;nov-17;Boutary
2;Good cooking;5.0;In common with so many good restaurants in Paris, the 'tasting menu' was the recommendation at Boutary. We were not disappointed in either the meal or the attentive and charming service that accompanied it. Each course was fully explained and comprised interesting combinations which balanced one another perfectly. Two well satisfied diners left after two and a half hours of high quality cooking at a relatively reasonable price. We will return again!;nov-17;Boutary
2;Creative cooking with wonderful service;5.0;This was one of the best dining experiences we had when in Paris. We ordered the chef's special dinner with wine and let the restaurant take care of us. Every course was perfect and served with style. This is a friendly, small restaurant with personal attention. Highly recommended.;oct-17;Boutary
2;Absolutely fantastic!;5.0;Food was delicious! Service great! Absolutely recommend visiting this place! Had 5 menu course with premium wine package.;oct-17;Boutary
2;Great place;5.0;Wonderful in intimate surrounding. Menu is limited but all courses were excellent. The emphasis is on caviar related dishes.;oct-17;Boutary
2;Outstanding service, excellent food and atmosphere.;5.0;Very personal service, several servers interacted with us. The certainly promote caviar, but there is much more to like - good fish, beef for instance. Wine prices especially very reasonable. A cut above any other restaurant in the area.;oct-17;Boutary
2;Perfection!;5.0;Perfection in everything. Exellent food in quality, cuison and asian influences in spices. Good wine list. All reasonable prices for the quality.;oct-17;Boutary
2;A decadent afternoon in Paris!;5.0;"My husband and I recently had lunch at Boutary: Wow! This should be on everyone's ""must do"" list for Paris. Sitting down in a cozy restaurant with excellent service(our server was outstanding in explaining their caviar service and wines that would pair with it). It was a fun afternoon of sampling caviar, having their famous: Mashed potatoes topped with caviar and enjoying great wine. Very relaxing atmosphere, coupled with plenty of menu options: With or without caviar. Our bill came to 65 euros.";oct-17;Boutary
2;SHOW ME THE CAVIAR!!!!!!;3.0;Thought it would be a caviar feast - instead it was a caviar fast! One dish had caviar on top of the potato - and that was sensational - so I ordered 2 - the rest of the tasting menu was heavenly but no caviar. We left hungry and craving caviar. And the price-fixed tasting menu for 2 was 49 euros each - adding on 1 wine pairing - was a mere 278 euros! You do the math.;oct-17;Boutary
2;Excellent food and very cosy atmosphere;5.0;We chose the 5 course menu with the premium wines and it turned out to be a good choice. The dishes were special indeed and well balanced (caviar...fish...veal...). It was like french modern cuisine with a very light touch from the East (the Chef is Corean). The service was also very professional.;oct-17;Boutary
2;OMG. I’ve gone to food heaven.;5.0;I don’t normally post reviews, but this restaurant deserves all the accolades it is receiving. My wife and I had the signature five course menu with premium wine. The service is fantastic, but what makes this restaurant so special is unique combination of ingredients that make every bite feel like you’ve died and gone to heaven. Paris has a ton of fantastic restaurants, but this up-and-coming gem needs to be at the top of your list.;oct-17;Boutary
2;Stunning, beautifully presented meal, friendly to children;5.0;We loved our dinner at Boutary! It's an unbelievable value - my husband and I had the 5-course tasting menu, which was elegantly presented, full of texture and flavor, with some really memorable dishes (like their caviar presentation, and smooth potatoes with a light cream and caviar), and wonderful wine pairings. The staff is very friendly and knowledgeable, and they were great with our twin daughters, who enjoyed the meal even more than we did, devouring their beef ham, John Dory, and pigeon.;oct-17;Boutary
2;Proposed to my girlfriend;5.0;The Boutary team was very helpful, anwsering all my questions and ideas up front, and nothing was an issue. Dinner was excellent, very good food and wines. They even made a special chocolate for my girlfriend (as i requested). Thanks for helping me with this special event! Will come back on some anniversary;oct-17;Boutary
2;Caviar at reasonable price and excellent food too;5.0;This restaurant located in St. Germain is cosy but seating is spacious and comfortable. The waiter was polite, knowledgable and attentive. The caviar master explained about caviar production, tasting, varieties to us and then served us with three types of caviar for comparison. The experience was memorable, educational and pleasant. We then ordered potatoes with caviar, turbot, lamb rack all served with caviar. The tomato dish was also not to be missed. It has tomatoes of different variety, tomato sorbet, tomato water and this dish was very refreshing. This restaurant offers very good food, good service, exceptional caviar experience at a reasonable price and we highly recommend it.;sept-17;Boutary
2;Fine dining;5.0;Boutary was an exceptional experience. Small and cozy, it is the perfect atmosphere for a romantic rendezvous. The staff is highly professional and kind, we could not ask for better service. A perfect evening in Paris, all thanks to Boutary.;oct-17;Boutary
2;A rising star;5.0;Paris is tricky. There is plenty of choice for 3 Michelin star restaurants but these tend to be OTT, hushed tone establish its that are anything but fun. Likewise, the city is full of decent brasseries but these are not places for contemporary cooking.Boutary was delightful - intelligent, beautifully judged dishes, modern and elegant. And the restaurant is fun. We were a group of 3 couples and had an outstanding dinner - the 5 course degustation plus the caviar tasting, which was the best any of us had every tasted and we all work in the hospitality industry.The service was superb, seamless, friendly (an exception in Paris), informative but without interrupting the flow.The wine list is short but some very well chosen French classics from top producers - the Nuits St Georges was stand out.Well be back!;oct-17;Boutary
2;Fantastic Dinner;5.0;I had a fantastic dinner at Boutary with my wife while we spent a week in Paris. We had the Signature Menu with wine pairing and the caviar sampling. We know little about caviar but the waiter was very knowledgeable and gave us a thorough lesson. It was delicious! Each course was fantastic. This was our best meal in Paris yet not the most expensive. The service was excellent and all of the staff spoke English very well. The price is very reasonable for the level of food. Highly recommended!;août-17;Boutary
2;Welcoming and Romantic;5.0;Just can't say enough about how friendly and helpful the staff were to us. The tasting menu was spectacular with delicious wine pairing and they took the time to learn my wife's preferences, recommending a wonderful Pinot Noir. Varied menu for all tastes, finely prepared. Elegant but not at all stuffy. Great evenings;oct-17;Boutary
2;Wonderful dining experience;5.0;Outstanding food and service. Will certainly have a Michelin star soon. Great wine choices and very knowledgeable staff.;sept-17;Boutary
2;fine flavors, limited by choice;3.0;We were there for lunch and opted for the lunch menu. Unfortunately, it only provided a single (yes one) choice for both starter and main. The appetizer was however beautifully presented and well executed with foie gras and a smoky flavored consumme. The main was a monkfish which was slightly rubbery and again, with the same style finished with a smoky flavored consumme. We had two choices for the desert and once again, it was well presented and delicious. Overall, can't really fault the meal except don't expect any choice if you wish to do the set menu. Quite unfortunate. Otherwise, it was fine. Doubt I would return again as it did not stand out to the many exceptional restaurants you will find in Paris;oct-17;Boutary
2;Degustation with 5 dishes;5.0;We had a full degustation dinner for two people (five dishes each and caviar / champagne to start with) along with premium wine selection offered by the restaurant. Everything was great, all five dishes were amazing and paired wines offered even greater pleasure:). The forth dish - veal meat was the greatest and most tasty food we have ever eaten. Huge recommendation from us!:)One small thing to improve on, we were left without water for slightly too long time. All in all - great experience!;sept-17;Boutary
2;What a find;5.0;Took the reviews off trip advisor and decided to try. We arrived early and they were kind enough to let us in. We sat upstairs in a very romantic corner. I am not a cavier person but my husband is and tried the sampler. I had the tomato app with tomato ice cream. What a tasty dish. The staff and the service could not have been nicer. A must in paris;sept-17;Boutary
2;One of the best gastronomic evenings I ever had;5.0;We ate at Boutary and it was incredible. We took the surprise menu with matching wines. Each course was exquisite and better than the previous. I hardly ever experienced so much flavours than at Boutary. And the matching wines were delicious as well. It is a strong recommendation.;sept-17;Boutary
2;VISIT THIS RESTAURANT!!!;5.0;When in Paris, you have to stop into Boutary. My wife and I made a reservation and were promptly seated upon arrival. They even gave us the option of sitting face to face or side by side. We did the 5 course tasting menu with premium wine pairings. Every dish was amazing, and the servers are extremely knowledgable about all of the food and wine. We also did a caviar tasting, which was accompanied by an explanation of the various species of Sturgeon and maturation process of said caviar. In closing, this is one of the best restaurant experiences we have had anywhere we have ever been.;sept-17;Boutary
2;Loved it;5.0;Rang up last minute for a table for 2. No problem! Was also in time to get tasting menu which is rare as this usually needs to be agreed in advance. Specialise in caviar which was new to me and explained so well by the team. Extremely generous portions. Well worth the money (which is extremely reasonable for the quality).Highlights:Service. Never been made to feel so genuinely welcome when in a fine dining restaurant. Usually service is reserved and lacking a bit in personality but not here. 2 guys in particular - one with light ish hair who explained the caviar and one with glasses who had spent time in Japan. Absolute professionals and made our experience. Stone bass. Never had fish like it - some unusual curing/brining method with gave firm bouncy texture. Potato and caviar. Signature dish - who'd of thought!Squid ink pickled veg - I think that's what he described it as. Looked a bit like coleslaw and was absolutely incredible.Desserts - light and delicious with precision and great sugar work;sept-17;Boutary
2;Incredible Food & Romantic Atmosphere;5.0;What a fabulous experience. The suckling pig dish was one of the best dishes I've had and was paired with potatoes topped with caviar. My palette was quite happy. We tried a bio wine that was also unique and delicious. One of my favorite places. Thank you for the good time!;sept-17;Boutary
2;Gourmet experience;5.0;Very tasty food for reasonable price and with exellent service. Set menu was was nice. Caviar tasting was nice, but you can miss it.;sept-17;Boutary
2;Fantastic tasting menu;5.0;We ate here in early September and had the tasting menu with the wine pairing. We both absolutely loved it. The service was fantastic and it felt very special and romantic in there. The food was absolutely delicious. We were so glad we chose the tasting menu as we tried some really interesting dishes and the wine went beautifully with each one. It was very expensive (up there with the most expensive meals I've had!) but we knew that before we booked, and it was very special so completely worth it. Don't miss out on this amazing experience!!;sept-17;Boutary
2;Dinner at Boutary;5.0;Dinner at Boutary was wonderful. The atmosphere of the front room was just right for an evening in Paris, and the waitstaff were friendly and very knowledgeable and made us feel at home. The caviar and food were delicious! We had the 5 course tasting menu with the premium wine pairing.;sept-17;Boutary
2;A serious spot;4.0;We took the menu dégustation. Very good idea. 79€ each plus 24-38 € wine menu each. Worth it. The wine was splendid. Each of the plates was magic, and we enjoyed a lot. A place to go to for special occasions, i guess.;sept-17;Boutary
2;Fine dining;5.0;Had the chefs menu with paired wines. Awesome. Stone bass and turbo were excellent. The veal had a great presentation and was quite tasty.;sept-17;Boutary
2;Great Romantic Dining;5.0;Loved the food and service in this small but very intimate dining establishment. We ordered the 5 course menu with premium wines and really enjoyed all the selections. I highly recommend.;août-17;Boutary
2;Great;4.0;We had the tasting menu and thought it was good/great, but not quite exceptional. The dishes peaked early on and the service fell away a little as the night went on. Overall the food is pretty special though and it's well worth a try.;août-17;Boutary
2;Excellent but not over-sophisticated;5.0;This a very nice place to have dinner, very good food, with some sophistication, perfect service, exquisite flavors, and short but adequate wine list.;août-17;Boutary
2;Outstanding restaurant;5.0;Best place we found to eat in paris. Brilliant staff and food in a really lovely setting, the best caviar I have ever tasted;août-17;Boutary
2;Wonderful service;5.0;We decided to go for the tasting menu with matched wines. The start was caviar, explained fully and served traditionally on the back of the hand! This was followed by stone bass. I found this a little too rare for my taste but the pickled vegetables were lovely. The highlight was the crushed potatoes with caviar. Delicious. The turbot was again good but a little underdone. Veal delicious but with tough fennel and barely cooked cabbage. Dessert amazing. Lychee, meringue, earl grey ice cream, again delicious. Coffee was ok. Overall not a perfect meal but an excellent experience with attentive and expert service. Worth a visit.;août-17;Boutary
2;Boutary;5.0;A wonderful restaurant. We had the taster menu with the recommended premium wines. The food was fantastic and wines beautifully complemented each course. A very special night in Paris!;août-17;Boutary
2;Paris visit;5.0;Looking for a nice place that would have great food and not break the bank. The food was excellent and well presented. The caviar that they are known for was fabulous and the service was outstanding. I would definitely recommend it to anyone visiting Paris and looking for a great food experience!;juil-17;Boutary
2;Beautiful Boutary;5.0;A must see for a wonderful Parisian dinner. The food is very high quality, imaginatively served. The staff make for a fun and joyous time. Everyone leaves with a big smile and great memories.;juin-17;Boutary
2;A real OMG experience.;5.0;"Just GO. A combination learning experience and ""are you kidding me?"" There is nothing on the menu which is less than spectacular. Yes, we had the caviar tasting selection, and then debated an encore, but finally settled for a simple extra fresh salad and a dessert that punctuated our stay. I have no doubt a star or two will be awarded soon. As I said, ""Just Go.""";juil-17;Boutary
2;Go now, before Michelin Stars spoil the secret!!;5.0;The title says it all. Small, intimate, passionate staff with fantastic food and wines. Go as a couple not as a group. Date night? Special Occassion? Boutary is perfect.;juin-17;Boutary
2;Fabulous.;5.0;Their branded caviar from France and Bulgaria is excellent. They offer a blind tasting with information to follow. Thee is a good selection of wine, champagne and vodkas. The menu choices are varied and a pleasure to the palate and eye. Don't waste your money at the Jules Verne as Alain Ducasse can't cook like this! The staff were very attentive and pleasant. The Boutary can accommodate pescetarian tastes. I was impressed with the taste, serving size, and appearance of all selections. Deserts are a work of art, but then again, so were the preceding dishes. The caviar is also excellent and reasonably priced. I know that this establishment is rated 4$, but I think that the pricing was appropriate for the taste and complexity of the meal.;juil-17;Boutary
2;Artful looking and great tasting dinner for our 40th anniversary;5.0;We ordered the chef choice tasting menu and they came out great. All the little dishes looked so nice that we did not want to break them. The cucumber, the caviar, the slow cooked smoked infused fish, the steak and lastly the desert. All are to die for. The waiter was very friendly. He was a foodie and funny as well.It was a little pricey but worth every cents;juin-17;Boutary
2;Boutary - Superb!;5.0;Outstanding food and service - great value. Everything about Boutary is first rate - can't wait to get back and will certainly recommend it to one and all.;juil-17;Boutary
2;Must eats;5.0;Unique and creative presentation. Caviar is a must. Very knowledgeable service . Clean and modern decor. Will revisit during next trip. Should be star worthy soon.;juil-17;Boutary
2;Yes, it is as good as others say...;5.0;Wow, what a treat. We went for the tasting menu plus the beluga caviar extra and premium wines. Absolutely amazing food but also top quality service. attentive, friendly and very knowledgable about the food and wine. The visit lived up to expectations following other fantastic reviews. A special treat for a special occasion with my wife.Thank you to the team at Boutary.;juil-17;Boutary
2;Great evening without a real highlight;4.0;We spent a lovely evening in the boutary. The food is of very high quality and the chef knows his craft. The service was very attentive and speaking English very well. All in all a very good experience. Still, and partly due to the fact that we have already had plenty of fine dining experiences, we were missing the wow effect! Something fresh, something innovativ, and something we haven't had seen so many times before. Again, everything was solid, even great, still we were looking for the small detail, the little difference that makes the place stand out.;juil-17;Boutary
2;Great food and great atmosphere;5.0;We went there together with family members from US. All of us are quite happy about the food and service. It a nice experience dining there. I hope we will come back some day.;avr-17;Boutary
2;The best food ever!;5.0;Ok I was a skeptic, but I was wrong. The flavors and the mix of foods was phenomenal! We are not foodies but this meal was all I wanted. Plus we told the waiter (federic) we never had a good meal in Paris and he recommended another place for next time. I truly loved this place and will return! I can only say, get ready to enjoy a true artistic and flavorful meal. We travel a lot and this is the place!;juil-17;Boutary
2;Hidden Gem;5.0;Just had the most wonderful dinner at Boutary. From Caviar to Dessert. Staff were attentive, friendly and knowledgeable.;juin-17;Boutary
2;Wonderful culinary experience;5.0;"Staff was respectful, knowledgeable and very accommodating. Food was very next level. Don't let the term ""caviar house"" fool you. These folks know their way around all food groups and spirits.";juin-17;Boutary
2;Amazing dinner for three generations!;5.0;Our family of 6 including grandparents and teenagers had an AMAZING dining experience at Boutary the last night we were in Paris. The food, service by Frederic and ambiance were outstanding, and everyone agreed this was our best meal of the week. We ordered off the a la carte menu and loved the caviar (even for those tasting for the first time!), steak tartar, turbot, pork belly and chicken. Highly recommended!;juin-17;Boutary
2;Perfect;5.0;A friend of mine lived in Paris last year and suggested this restaurant . It has an unusual spin with the caviar focus . The people are super nice and make the dinner an experience with explanations. But yet very relaxed-- not pretentious. It is in the cool part of town. It really does not get any better than this. We were here on the hottest day ever in Paris. It was a little warm but we were fine. And-- they are installing air conditioning.;juin-17;Boutary
2;Stuck in a corner;3.0;We booked this for a weekend trip to Paris to celebrate my husband's birthday, and we included this information in our booking. We were placed upstairs in a side corridor next to another empty table for two. There was a bigger room behind us that was also empty. It was unusually hot and this small room area was airless and sweltering. We ate most of our dinner alone upstairs, till slowly other people arrived. Another couple took the other table, and soon the waiter brought them a fan and aimed it at them, without checking how we were doing. The food is delicious and cannot be faulted but the lack of ambience and comfort was disappointing. We left before dessert as we were bored and too hot!;juin-17;Boutary
2;Wonderful;5.0;We had a great time at Boutary.The staff are well informed and provide great service.the restaurant is cosy in the inner room and lively in the front room.This is all nice but the best thing is the food it self.Every thing we orderd was wonderful and out of the ordinary, from starters to the desserts.The waiters keep on explaining about the way to eat a caviar to every customer which can be annoying after the third time...But overall our experience with Boutary is exceptional and I will definetly come back.It deserved a 5 star review.;juin-17;Boutary
2;Outstanding;5.0;My wife and I had lunch on a Friday, at first the modest building and dinning room conceal the brilliance of this restaurant. The food is superb and the service most engaging. One of our best ever meals. Just go.......... you will love it!;juin-17;Boutary
2;Wow!!!!!!!!!!!!!!;5.0;Location: very nice area, with lot´s of Art-Galleries. busy, small street this rue Mazarine, also lot´s af nice Bars around, to take a drink after dinnerBuilding: typical French Restaurant, 1 room low Level, with one big toilett (very clean) and 1 room upstairs, where also kitchen isFood: focused on Kaviar, lot´s of dishes contains Kaviar, but you find also without. very delicous taste. a little bit expensive, but excellentService: very helpfull, very good english;juin-17;Boutary
2;Best food experience in France!;5.0;Me and my wife celebrated two years of marriage at this lovely place. Have to say that the service and food was some of the best we've ever had. The servers had great knowledge about the dishes and different wines. And you have to try the smoked, mashed potato with caviar dish. It was simply amazing!!! Wish i could give more than 5 stars for this. Will definetly go here again if we come back to Paris. +++++;juin-17;Boutary
2;Go for the 5 course with wine tasting;5.0;Most fine dining restaurants will offer a fixed course menu, but will never offer you the same experience for wine, here at the Boutary you get to try three different wines of superb quality for the price of a mid range bottle of Bordeaux, this is the kind of restaurant that will restore your faith in dinning.;juin-17;Boutary
2;The best meal I have ever eaten in Paris.;5.0;Charles and his team could not have made us feel more welcome and the food and service were out of this world. We had the tasting menu (with the premium flight of wines) with Caviar tasting and it was sensational. The Potato with Caviar might just be the best thing I have ever eaten, and we have eaten in places like The Fat Duck, The Waterside Inn, Le Manoir aux Quat Saisons etc.Boutary makes Caviar accessible to all, without any stuffiness and it was a fun and enjoyable experience, not to mention how informative it was!We chose to buy some Caviar for ourselves and as a gift for friends, and Charles kindly arranged for it to all be beautifully packaged, in ice and sent to our hotel. Truly fabulous service.Please, please consider opening a restaurant in London - its a unique concept and I think it would be a huge success. Until then, we will eat here every time we visit Paris from now on.;juin-17;Boutary
2;Fabulous Food, Fabulous Service;5.0;What can I add to the many wonderful reviews this restaurant has already received. We were cosseted from the moment of arrival by the wonderfully attentive staff. Opting for the tasting menu, together with a caviar tasting, and the staffs' choice of wines was an excellent choice. My partner had never tasted caviar and was very nervous but we were both blown away by the exquisite buttery taste which was not at all fishy. This was just the start of a taste journey which went from one sublime dish to another. The matched wines were equally divine. Yes, this is not the sort of meal we can afford on a regular basis. but as a very very special treat it was well worth every penny, and we floated away afterwards on feet of air. Thank you to all at Boutary for such a wonderful experience.;févr-17;Boutary
2;Perfect!;5.0;I could not ask for more from restaurant. Super friendly service and awesome food. I ate couple of dishes that were best I have ever had. Next time I go to Paris this is the first place where I want to eat.;févr-17;Boutary
2;Highly enjoyable meal and service;5.0;Course menu with wine pairing was excellent value for quality of food, cooking, and flavors. Nice balance between creative nouveau and traditional. Atmosphere and service was cozy, inviting, and personal. Would've liked to have had more caviar sampling but will leave that for next time! Definitely goes into the rolodex for a return visit.;mai-17;Boutary
2;Great food and atmosphere!;5.0;Food and services were great. Had a great time and it was definitely the highlight of the trip. Would recommend.;juin-17;Boutary
2;Very interesting menu. very friendly, personable service;5.0;Excellent food, preparation but the thing we lied best was the excellent service and attention to detail.;juin-17;Boutary
2;A food experience!;5.0;My wife and I had the taster menu with caviar and it was out of this world. Very attentive and knowledgeable staff.;mai-17;Boutary
2;Superb;5.0;A perfectly prepared.dinner. Somewhat restricted menu with fixed prix but typical of Paris restaurants. It is regarded as a superior caviar restaurant, but I am not a caviar lover so I cannot comment on that aspect of the menu. However, the meal was spectacular. Their homemade fois gras was smooth and favorable. Really excellent. The pig suckling was exceptional. The pork was as rare as allowed and really tender. It also came with a piece of filet that was wrapped in a filo type crust that had a shredded wheat texture with a cheese infused flavor. The cold crab ravioli appetizer was moist and very flavorable. This restaurant is exceptional and absolutely worth visiting.;juin-17;Boutary
2;Excellent meal! Favorite in Paris!;5.0;We went all out and had the 5 course menu with paired premium wines and caviar tasting. This was our first time trying caviar so getting the history and details was very interesting. Every course was absolutely delicious (best potatoes I've ever had in my life) and the wine pairings were spot on. Visiting this restaurant is a must while in Paris, it was a very memorable meal! The Prescription Cocktail Club is right next door, I would recommend stopping in before or after dinner for a cocktail to add even more to the experience!;mai-17;Boutary
2;Close;4.0;No little snack before or after the meal -- No offering of port or Madeira - they do a lot of good stuff but come close but not completely there -- they aspire to a star -- need more work. But, it is a fabulous meal for the price;mai-17;Boutary
2;Wonderful lessons in caviar and a great meal!;4.0;Japanese-Korean chef that specializes in caviar. Started with a 1 month aged Siberian caviar, second course was crab ravioli in kohlrabi, then a smoked puree potato with 4 month aged beluga, roasted brill in olive oil with asparagus, veal in a wine reduction, and a Parisian baba with rum and mojito ice cream. Sometimes when you get a wine pairing you get an education on the different varieties and regions, well the caviar lesson was the same. Didn't try it but they also have an extensive vodka selection.;mai-17;Boutary
2;Caviar delight;5.0;My wife and I are novices at Caviar but we want to learn and no better place than Boutary.The food and experience was great, such a comfortable place to taste some of the most exclusive food!!Thanks;mai-17;Boutary
2;Creative cuisine;5.0;We really enjoyed our meal at Boutary. The uniqueness of the combination of flavours was amazing. The presentation was excellent;mai-17;Boutary
2;The most amazing dining experience my husband and I have ever had.;5.0;If you are in Paris and you are looking for an exceptional fine dining experience this is the place to go.The atmosphere in the restaurant is very romantic and cozy. All of the staff is professional and friendly, and they all spoke French and English.The menu had so many amazing things we wanted to try that we could not decide. We ended up doing a 5 course surprise chef selection tasting menu along with 3 different types of paired wines. We also ordered an extra appy that we so badly wanted to try. It was the best choice we made. We still cannot get over how amazing the food quality was.There is nothing negative that we can say about this place. If we are ever in Paris again we will definitely go back to this restaurant.;mai-17;Boutary
2;Outstanding!!;5.0;We had our aniversary dinner there! We are not used to eating caviar but it was really amazing! The service, the quality of the product they serve and the food in general is great!! An amazing choice if you are in Paris and want an amazing dinner and do not want to pay more than 100usd per person.;mai-17;Boutary
2;A gem in the heart of Paris!;5.0;"We had a fantastic dinner at Boutary with friends earlier in May. Fantastic modern food (particularly loved the crab starter and also the ""caviar potato""), bold decoration, refined but relaxed atmosphere, great service (sleek, efficient and friendly) and also a good location on the Left Bank. Also while the restaurant has plenty more to offer than just caviar, it is definitely a good occasion to try it and taste the various types.";mai-17;Boutary
2;Delicious!!!;5.0;The Maigre confit a l'huilde d'olive was soooooooo good! And the service here was amazing! Definitely worth visiting!;déc-16;Boutary
2;great;5.0;The decor, room, service were perfect! We took the tasting menu with as a bonus the tasting of caviar accompanied by a Vodka!;janv-17;Boutary
2;Wowwww;5.0;Lets say that after 4 days I still have the good taste in my mouth. Stuff was really friendly.Lets say great little resturant. Not cheap but worth every cent :);mai-17;Boutary
2;Delicious Fun, Best Service, Lots of Caviar!;5.0;What a pleasant surprise: my favorite Champagne, tastes of caviar, lovely main course and to top it off, the attentions of the Maitre d' to answer any questions. This is a small, cozy restaurant with a lot of charm, great location and reasonable prices for Paris.;avr-17;Boutary
2;A hidden gem of excellence;5.0;We came here for a celebratory dinner on our wedding anniversary and expected a good but not elaborate meal. We had an excellent meal, served with style, enthusiasm and flair. We opted for the tasting menu with wine pairings. We were thrilled by every plate and surprised by the wines which were so well chosen. It was one of the finest meals I have ever had in Paris. The food is stylish and clever but not overly so. there is no pretension here but there is real emphasis on style without compromising or overcomplicating taste. I would love to see who is working the kitchen as there was elements of france and fusion with other traditions. I also so appreciate restaurants in Paris that know you are trying to use your french and only speak french back to you.;mai-17;Boutary
2;Explosion of flavors;5.0;Really an amazing place, excellent food with a good balance of originality. I will never forget the taste of the meat. Service is just perfect. Very reasonable prices for this high quality of food. I m definitely looking forward to go again! Highly recommended;avr-17;Boutary
2;Wonderfull meal;5.0;I made a reaervation through the fork about 4 weeks in advance. I ordered the tasting menu including wine and caviar tasting. Every plate was creativ, hot, and delicious! The wine pairing was perfect. I'd love to go back there on my next visit to Paris.;mai-17;Boutary
2;Every dish was excellent;5.0;We had the 5-course tasting menu and loved every single dish: two appetizers, two main courses, and a dessert. One of the main courses was beef. I do not eat much red meat and was prepared to give half of it to my husband - until I tasted it. The sauce was so good that I finished the whole thing myself! Every dish was the perfect blend of flavours even down to the delicious desserts. The pistachio cream had the best pistachio flavour I had ever had in a dessert, and the mojito ice cream was beautiful when blended with the rum baba. It was also fun to learn about caviar and taste three different kinds. It was a memorable meal and we will definitely be back.;mai-17;Boutary
2;Memorable Dining Experience;5.0;Attractive presentation, excellent service, and delectable food. I enjoy cod in all its iterations and the cod served at Boutary is exemplary. We enjoyed the presentation of the caviar. Simply said we had a fun and memorable dining experience.;avr-17;Boutary
2;Amazing Dining Experience!;5.0;We chose this restaurant for our last dinner in Paris because it was highly rated on Trip advisor! We were not disappointed at all!! My husband and I did the Chef's menu with the caviar and the premium wines and it was delicious! The caviar was amazing and even our 11 year old son loved it! The staff were so attentive and helpful with everything.;avr-17;Boutary
2;Delicious food and great service;5.0;My husband and I decided to try this restaurant in the St Germain neighborhood on a whim. I'm so glad we did. The food was amazing and the wait staff were really friendly. We decided not to try their signature tasting menu as we weren't that hungry (5 courses). We ordered the pork and chicken main dishes and the foie gras and the crab starters. They were delicious. Again I can't say enough about the friendly service and great food. I would definitely go back. It is on the more expensive side but well worth the additional euros.;mai-17;Boutary
2;Unsatisfactory;3.0;The place has is a bit dingy. The food is of good quality but there is no atmosphere. Do not feel like coming back.;avr-17;Boutary
2;Amazing;5.0;You will never be sorry that you ate at Boutary. I can't be positive enough about the food or the personalized service. You'll love it.;nov-16;Boutary
2;Perfect restaurant for our last night in Paris;5.0;Delicious food from the first bite of caviar to the last bite of rum baba with mojito sorbet. We'd never had high quality caviar before and thoroughly enjoyed the tasting of 3 different kinds. The foie gras appetizer with veal cheeks was outstanding, as was the main course of brill fish. We had one of the best bottles of wine we've ever had, as recommended by our thoroughly delightful and extraordinarily knowledgeable server, Frederic. If we're ever lucky enough to return to Paris, we will definitely eat at Boutary again. In the meantime, we'll recommend it highly to anyone we know who's going to Paris!;avr-17;Boutary
2;Wonderful experience;5.0;My wife and I have had an amazing experience at Boutary. We have ordered the degustation menu with paired wines and it was an excellent choice.;avr-17;Boutary
2;Caviar Heaven;5.0;"So here's the thing, if you're a caviar lover, this is the place you need to go in Paris. Not only do they have an awesome caviar tasting (yes you can put the scoop of goodness served to you on your hand and lick it up) but full fledged caviar lovers ( you know who you are) can delve into a ""blind"" tasting of three different caviars and rate them! Really this lunch was so much more than I expected! It was fun, it was romantic and different. But wait someone in your party isn't a caviar lover? Surprise! Lovely menu with amazing starters such as fresh asparagus and goat cheese flan ( which I am still remembering how it tasted weeks later since it was that awesome) and both lamb and pork specials. Decent wine list and super friendly staff. Kudos to Charles the manager that day who made the experience so much fun and made me want to go to ""caviar"" school if there was such a thing because his knowledge and passion for the creation, harvesting, serving and presentation of caviar brought it to a true art form. Merci!";avr-17;Boutary
2;Excellent dinner;5.0;Excellent dinner in modern setting (red and goldfish walls), the food is great (for a non stared Michelin restaurant) and the staff friendly. Price quality excellent for a non formal dinner. Mainly couples.;avr-17;Boutary
2;Ok food - touristy and over priced;3.0;We had dinner here. It was good but there was something missing that would make me hesitant to recommend it. Perhaps it was too touristy. This could be as a result of such a high trip advisor score. All clients of the restaurant were English speaking. The service was ok but a bit dismissive. The food was good. No amuse bouche. Entrees, smoked potato with caviar and crab, were ok but not great. A bit bland and in need of seasoning.Mains, chicken and beef, were better but not great. Dessert, praline and coffee, was nice but a bit heavy.The meals with wine cost €200, this was more than it was worth.Would not recommend or return.;avr-17;Boutary
2;Our best meal in Paris!;5.0;"We had a fantastic experience atBoutary last night! The menu is small but mighty. I had the cod with crab cream sauce (melt in your mouth!) and my husband had the chicken. His quote... ""40 euro for chicken?"" After tasting it...""Absolutely!"" Our server and culinary guide William made our experience seamless- from seating to departure, everything was wonderful. Kai made some of the best wine and food pairing suggestions -she has talent - and her approachability and personality makes you feel welcome right away. And Charles (I think he is the owner?) gave us a great education on caviar (we recommend you try it-even if you think you don't want to... trust us, it's amazing!) Clearly the owner and staff have a passion for food and wine... all things gastronomically pleasing!";avr-17;Boutary
2;Exceptional meal;5.0;A really fun and tasty meal that the whole family enjoyed (2 adults + 18 + 20 year olds). Everything was delicious. If anything, I would say the slow-cooked cod was to buttery/soft, but everything was good. All three deserts are amazing. The rum-drenched banana cake was maybe the best. Nice service. Fun bathroom. A perfect evening.;avr-17;Boutary
2;Absolutely Amazing!;5.0;We enjoyed everything here, the Caviar, the wine, the appetizer, the main food! I ordered the cod plate, not only the fish and sauce was amazing, the side dish was unbelievably divine!;avr-17;Boutary
2;The best in Paris.;5.0;My husband and I visited this beautiful restaurant in Paris and it was absolutely lovely. The Korean Japanese chef was brilliant and staff were very kind too.;avr-17;Boutary
2;Loved;5.0;My boyfriend and I loved our experience here. The restaurant is beautiful, and service was impeccable. We opted for the tasting menu, and it appeared that most others around us did as well. I would highly recommend the tasting menu. We also opted for the caviar tasting and wine pairing. Would agree to both again as the caviar tasting was great, and the wines paired perfectly with our food. I'll be dreaming about this meal for some time to come.;avr-17;Boutary
2;Great evening out;5.0;Impeccable service. Exquisite food. The caviar was amazing and they are flexible to dealing with dietary restrictions!;avr-17;Boutary
2;Exeptionnel;5.0;Very good food and food and very attentive service. We very much enjoyed the caviar and Frederic explained that it comes from Bulgaria. Excellent value for money. Highly recommend.;mars-17;Boutary
2;Gastronomic adventure;5.0;We chose this restaurant for our last night in Paris. What a great choice! Very adventurous menu, with interesting choices. We went with the fixed menu- great choice. We had two appetizers- crab in kohlrabi ravioli with cucumber jelly, followed by potatoes in lemon cream with caviar. What a great marriage of flavours! Our mains were sea bass with vegetables and beef paired with an amazing cherry purée. Dessert was equally decadent, and all was accompanied by a lovely wine from their excellent wine list. Highly recommend for a special evening or if you just want to indulge yourself. The staff was very friendly and helpful. We will definitely visit again when we next visit Paris!;mars-17;Boutary
2;40th meal-stunning;5.0;I booked this restaurant through trip advisor as a treat for my partners 40th birthday, and a treat it certainly was. Food was up there with the best we have had anywhere in the word. Wines were well matched and stunning. Great service and an interesting, unique and classy look to the place.;oct-16;Boutary
2;Fabulous;5.0;Great food and very attentive service. Frederic looks after you like you are a special friend. Excellent value for money also, especially considering it involves caviar. Highly recommend.;mars-17;Boutary
2;Wonderful little place;5.0;Amazing restaurant. Went there for lunch and it was superb. There's so many great options in the area but this one stood out and did not disappoint. Highly recommend it!;mars-17;Boutary
2;Wonderful meal, causal and welcoming enviornment;5.0;"We ate here one night when we were visiting Paris. The food was excellent. We enjoyed our wine, apps and entrees. Dishes were innovative and unique without being too far ""out there"". Interesting flavor combinations. Would highly recommend.";mars-17;Boutary
2;Good tasting menu;4.0;Interesting decor - quite modern. The 5 course tasting menu was very good and at Euros 75 good value for money. Restaurant was full which may have contributed to slightly erratic service;mars-17;Boutary
2;Sublime experience;5.0;Impeccable service, friendly staff and a sense of excitement and drama.The food was beautifully executed with flourishes of caviar and truffles, all with perfect wine pairings.The maitre d' Frederic was the perfect host, ever pleasant, informative and accommodated our requests. There was even the special finale of desserts and sparklers to celebrate our anniversary.I would go back again and again....;mars-17;Boutary
2;Beyond fantastic!!!;5.0;My new favorite restaurant in Paris!! Everything was perfect, from the service to the presentation, and especially the food. The service was perfect...friendly, personal, prompt and timely (not too fast, not too slow...just right). We started with a caviar tasting which was fantastic. We went with the tasting menu and each course was inventive, flavorful, and simply fantastic. The 12-week aged beef was incredible. The wine pairings were so good, they not only complemented the food, but the food complemented the wine. I highly recommend Boutary and look forward to visiting again.;mars-17;Boutary
2;Wonderful & highly gastronomic lunch;5.0;"Next to a professional and friendly reception, the CAVIAR is delicious and the ""dejeuner"" was an extraordinary experience in fine dining.Keep up Boutary-team, we will be back";mars-17;Boutary
2;As good as expected;5.0;After reading so many good reviews about the restaurant we wanted to try it and we are glad we did,it is very good ,creative and it probably deserve a star at the michelin.we had the menu degustation which has 5 courses and 3 pairing wines.Each dish was good and worked well,one is with caviar and potatoes, an excellent combination.The quality/price of the meal is one of the best I have experienced.the restaurant is small,so reservation is a must.the welcome is warm.if there is a critic,it would be the wait between courses that is a little on the long side but not overly.;mars-17;Boutary
2;Authentic!!!;5.0;The service was friendly and impeccable. They gave a history of caviar and explained the traditional way to eat it.The food was amazing. Delicious chicken, veal, and truffle rice cakes.;mars-17;Boutary
2;Excellent lunch;5.0;We just ordered the dish of the day and it was really excellent. The food was well balanced and very tasty. I'm not a big dessert guy but it was surprisingly good and not too sweet. Highly recommended. Good and friendly service too.;mars-17;Boutary
2;Nice service, cuisine and environment;5.0;Excellent food with a speciality in caviar. Dishes to opt for: cod (à la carte) and saint Jacques (including in the formule);mars-17;Boutary
2;Superb Caviar!;5.0;I was here with a friend on Friday evening for dinner. I had the five course tasting menu with premium wines. Each course did not look filling but they were incredibly delicious. We also added the caviar tasting. I have eaten a lot of caviar but this was not fishy at all. My friend who really don't love the taste of fish loved this caviar. It was not tasted off a ring as suggested online, but off the side of your hand. For those interested, we tasted the Ossietra Caviar.You will also have Caviar on one of the courses.The wine was superb! Each glass complimented the course.I loo forward to dining here again!!;mars-17;Boutary
2;Caviar and a Delightful Meal;5.0;A small group of friends and I went in February and very much enjoyed our meal at Boutary. The restaurant was small, but we were fortunate enough to be seated downstairs at a lovely, intimate setting. The place specializes in caviar, which was presented in a small box of the trays, along with an envelope containing a card explaining the various caviar. We were encouraged to and did try each and then read the card, learning the distinctions of the various caviar. The wine and entres that followed were equally delightful, and the staff was friendly and accommodating. I will return on other trips to Paris.;févr-17;Boutary
2;Terrific Dinner;5.0;We had a fantastic dinner , it was delicious. .. loved the wine list.. The ambiance and service was perfect. Definitely recommend our friends .;janv-17;Boutary
2;Beautuful;5.0;A lovely little restaurant with perfect service and lovely food. The menu is tiny, so you need to be not too fussy about what you eat. The caviar is divine, but of course super expensive. Beautiful café gourmand rounded off a lovely meal.;févr-17;Boutary
2;Perfect experience;5.0;I went there as form of a celebration and it was just perfect. The staff were great, they explain each dish.The caviar sampling was amazing, it made me fall in love again with it. The dishes all had their unique flavour and taste that fills u up in the right way. I absolutely enjoyed my dinner and left with a smile on my face. I would recommend the scallops for the main course.;févr-17;Boutary
2;Great dinner;4.0;Great service , food was phenomenal , would go back anytime ! The bathroom was the most unique I've seen in sometime .;févr-17;Boutary
2;Fantastic meal;5.0;Hi,We had a fantastic meal here a few weeks ago.It is very interestingly decorated and feels like a renovated old house. It exemplified the approach of the restaurant for me. Classical French cooking updated with a modern and slightly unconventional approach. We had the five course signature menu and it was great. Service was a little bit slow to start with, but once we got going everything was great. We were served by a superb member of staff, who had outstanding English, and was able to explain each course to us with genuine aplomb. The scallops dish, was for me, one of the best meals I have ever eaten. Easily Michelin star quality. The Galiciain beef was outstanding, as were the desserts which we got one of each and shared. Not at all surprised that this place comes so highly recommended. It isn't cheap sure, but the quality of the food and experience was certainly commensurate with what we paid.;févr-17;Boutary
2;Super dinner;5.0;First I booked for 6, then 7 people than we arrived 11! The restaurant was professional. Same time you feel the way passion. The menu degustation was excellent. We all enjoyed all the bites. My personal favorite was the scallops and the praline.;févr-17;Boutary
2;Diner;5.0;My wife & I found this place through Trip Advisor , glad we did. It was worth the Uber ride over the bridge, everything was amazing, especially the caviar. We highly recommend this restaurant when in Paris.;févr-17;Boutary
2;Amazing French Seafood!;5.0;We were walking in the area and ask a French couple for a seafood restaurant they send us to Boutary. We look at Tripasvisor and read the last reviews, we did a reservation thru Fork App butI think walk ins are welcome. We decide to take the5 course menu and we ask for a Bottle Wine pairing. All the courses were well presented and rich flavors, all were well explained, service is really good.;févr-17;Boutary
2;Good not great;4.0;Caviar fan? Go here. Otherwise there are better nearby options. It's good but the food doesn't quite match the prices especially compared to the competition.;févr-17;Boutary
2;Great staff, great restaurant;5.0;A cosy and intimate restaurant, the food was well presented, full of flavour and well priced. . Their caviar was so creamy and delicious I could have eaten it all evening. Staff delightful. A wonderful evening.;févr-17;Boutary
2;Just perfect...;5.0;"Few words can describe this restaurant and experience ""Just Perfect"" The service is very professional and friendly and they speak fluent English. The ambiance is very upscale. Guest check average 50€+. I recommend the Caviar, Tarama de tourteau and Beef fillet with trufles. Photos attached";févr-17;Boutary
2;Hole in the wall;5.0;Loved everything about this place. Food was good and it was nice and quiet for my family and into enjoy our dining experience;févr-17;Boutary
2;Dinner was delicious;4.0;We were two couples that came for dinner. We all went with the 5 course tasting and wine pairing. The first dish was a poached scallop with a fruit sauce served with an amazing white wine. Then we were served a rice dish with caviar that was smooth and delicious. Then came scallops, followed by a beef dish. Lastly was a dessert. All the dishes were very beautifully done and tasted amazing. I highly recommend this place for dinner. I took off one star for service as it was very very slow. It took ages to take our order and then to ask us about each course. Meanwhile the table next to us was served much quicker than us. Seems a bit unfair for the large party to get better service since we were just 4.;janv-17;Boutary
2;Luxury lunch;5.0;Charming little place. Warmly greeted by host, not crowded, chpoice of tables on ground floor. Discussed caviar and ate it!Delicious! Also tastry cod with mussels, with more caviar!Atmosphere lovely , relaxed, great luch on cold winter day!;janv-17;Boutary
2;Horrible;1.0;We have been lucky to travel all,over the world. I always research and plan/book as much if not every facet of our trips in advance and have used TripAdvisor almost without fail. It is a lot less stressful this way. This was a complete bust and one of the very few times that I have ever been let down by TripAdvisor and the legion of other uber travelers who post reviews. Service slow, food worse and massively overpriced to the other 4 nights we ate in Paris. Maybe just an off ight for them but my take is bad, bad bad. Would like to hear others who recently ate there. Thank you.;janv-17;Boutary
2;Left bank charm;5.0;Warm welcome and warm ambiance on a cold January evening. A small but excitingly diverse menu and similarly well developed wine list. Excellent attention at the table without ever feeling hurried. This an intimate restaurant for dinner as a couple.;janv-17;Boutary
2;Relaxing Dinner;5.0;We went there on the basis of the recommendations of trip advisor and were notdisappointed. The food was good, the prices fair, the wine suggestions appropriate,and the service helpful. On a Saturday evening we were surrounded mostly by quiet Parisian couples, which made for a relaxing dinner.;déc-16;Boutary
2;great experience;5.0;we had a great time, learned about caviar from the owner Charles. The food was very very good and wine pairing perfect. one of those evenings you remember for a long time.;janv-17;Boutary
2;Caviar Tasting;5.0;Great experience caviar tasting and comparing. Loved the chicken broth and the cod. Good service too.;janv-17;Boutary
2;Cosy, refined, great menu and caviar at an affordable price;4.0;I loved the fact that the food was creative but light. The kind of dinner you feel satisfied about without having to worry about having eaten too much and too fat. We had an introduction to caviar tasting that was enjoyable. The potato with caviar is an absolute must. Service is very friendly.;janv-17;Boutary
2;Impressive and lovely. Perfect.;5.0;Perfect flavours and wonderfully presented dishes . sophisticated and warm yet modern atmosphere . welcoming and thoughtful staff. Absolutely perfect.;déc-16;Boutary
2;Excellent food & a great introduction to caviar;5.0;We had a great time at Boutary! Service was excellent, food even better! We had very good advices on the wines too :)We were welcomed by the owner Charles who is passionate about fine cuisine and definitely knows his stuff when it comes to caviar.Not everything is about caviar though and if it's not your thing, the rest of the menu just make you want to order everything :)The lobsters and foie gras were sublime!I would suggest though you have a test of it 'à la royale' (only 9€), the way the tsar's tasters use to do it :)A great food experience overall.;janv-17;Boutary
2;Genuinely impressed;4.0;A great little place, worthy of its rave reviews. Don't be thrown by its (deserved, and well worth exploring) reputation for caviar - the real gems are the impeccable service, the well selected wine list and the adventurousness of the tasting menu. A place worth marking a spot in the calendar for (but do make a point of trying the caviar. If not here, then where?);janv-17;Boutary
2;crowd sourcing doesn't always work;2.0;this is the # 3 rated restaurant in Paris . I'm sure I went to it. Being more than generous you could say the food was average but I thought it was bland, almost tasteless. The wine list was OK, nothing special. The service was quite good and the ambiance - just OK. It was supposed to be expensive and I thought it was at the high end of moderate.There are so many great restaurants in Paris why ever would you choose this one unless you read all the tripadvisor reviews - people are afraid to say what they really thought and mindlessly give this great reviews because everyone else did;janv-17;Boutary
2;Caviar!;4.0;Very cool ambience, exceptional service, caviar tasting to die for. Tasting menu good, but not great - though certainly cheaper than other michelin star establishments & the overall experience just as good. You can tell they are really trying. Give it a try for something cool & certainly If you love really good caviar!;janv-17;Boutary
2;DIfferent and worthwhile;4.0;Boutary offers a fun dining experience. Cavier lovers will enjoy the presentation and variety. That said, in our view, the meal did not live up to the glowing reviews on Tripadvisor. We are lovers of fine cuisine. and (again in our view) the chef has a bit further to go in that direction. Physically, the place is charming and the service is first rate. We were happy to have chosen Boutary, but we probably will not return.;déc-16;Boutary
2;Best meal in Paris!;5.0;This was our best meal in Paris! Absolutely fantastic, from the caviar tasting on. Only four main dishes were offered--our table had all four, and all were absolutely excellent! The staff was wonderfully helpful and friendly, and the decor is lovely. All in all, an absolutely wonderful dining experience. So happy we were able to get a reservation. Can't wait to come back on our next visit to Paris.;déc-16;Boutary
2;Cosy, friendly, creative and healthy;5.0;A cute place in saint germain with à cosy atmosphere. Good service. We took a menu. It was nicely light and delicious. The potatoes with caviar are a must. The cod was perfectly cooked. And we ended with a Mont Blanc. Staff was helpful and service was quick.;déc-16;Boutary
2;😃😃😃💎💎💎 oh yeah;5.0;I've been to a few places in my life. This place hit top 3. Amazing food, super service and relaxing atmosphere. Couldn't ask for anything more.;déc-16;Boutary
2;Very nice;5.0;We saw a review in TripAdvisor and went for a shot.Great service but it was late and we could not have the full menu.All we had was very goodHi for it;déc-16;Boutary
2;Fine dining with relaxed atmosphere;4.0;Incredibly friendly staff at this 'hip' place! Do the caviar tasting just for the sake of it as it was fascinating!We had a main which was delicious but we really didn't do the menu justice as we'd had a substantial lunch! Would love to go back for their degustation!;déc-16;Boutary
2;Authentic french and worth a visit..... Worth a Michelin Star;5.0;We booked a month in advance after reading reviews and articles on Boutary. The menu is seasonal and with only a few key dishes. We had great service and the food was sublime. My husband said he could die a happy man after eating the Oyster Dish :) - Caviar and champagne is a must do!!! Dessert was off the charts. Well Done!!!! I would recommend to anyone with a fancy palette;nov-16;Boutary
2;A real gem and a very exquisite dining experience;5.0;"A business partner recommended this lovely restaurant. very romantic setting in a quiet left-bank side street.Great choices of white and red wines, very nice collection of ""second cru classes"" from Bordeaux, reasonably priced. We had a white from Santenay, which was lovely and accompanied the ""decouverte menu"" extremely well. This menu consisted of five dishes, all of which were excellent and real stand-outs - all of this was very reasonably priced. The menu itself doesnot carry too many dishes, and if you eat the decouverte menu, you get a very good glimpse of the menu. We chose not to have the caviar, but next time, we come, we will do so. There was also a very impressive list of vodkas. Great experience. We'll come back.";déc-16;Boutary
2;A true Paris gem;5.0;We found this place through Tripadvisor, by searching for nearby restaurants to our hotel. as we wanted a rather light meal having arrived in Paris quite late.The restaurant met all expectations that was set by all the positive reviews from previous guests. The food was very well presented and the cooking proved to be excellent.Slightly disappointing wine list, but the waitor knew the details about the wines on the list, and made excellent recommendations;nov-16;Boutary
2;Romantic and Caviar;4.0;A very good and romantic caviar restaurant on the left bank. Nice decoration, impeccable service, innovative food. I recommend the Margaux 2010 wine at a very good price.;nov-16;Boutary
2;Excellent food and service!;5.0;The server is knowledgeable and very friendly. He speaks french english and spanish... The food is delicious and of high quality. We had a chance to see the chef to thank him. We enjoyed the experience.;déc-16;Boutary
2;did not believe the reviews until we ate there;5.0;this little new restaurant was such a surprise because we live in the neighbourhood and did not know about it until we saw it on trip advisor. The service was perfect and the food was wonderful. So fresh and beautifully prepared. This will definitely be on our list, and we are lucky to have it so close. It definitely rivals any star restaurant.;nov-16;Boutary
2;Fantastic Restaurant and Wondeful Service;5.0;We ate here on Friday 25th November 2016. We had the 5 course tasting menu with wine pairing it was sensational. The food and innovation was beautiful and the atmosphere was brilliant and all of the staff were faultless. This is a must go to in Paris. Although it is fine dinning, it certainly wasn't over priced.;nov-16;Boutary
2;Magnificent;5.0;From start to finish an absolute delight. Hopefully this is a Michelin rated restaurant. I am already dying and dreaming to go back. Thank you for the exotic and passionate meal you served us as it was gorgeous as well as Devine!!!;oct-16;Boutary

The food tasted great all around and the restaurant provides a delightful environment. I will definitely would like to go back and visit again.;oct-16;Boutary
2;Brilliant;5.0;Probably one of the best place to have dinner currently in Paris. Charles, the owner, is very knowledgeable and makes the experience truely unique.;août-16;Boutary
2;Very good and at the right price;5.0;We were three for dinner and tried different dishes, from heart of salmon to cod with vegetables and lamb. Everything was great and really accurate.

The design of the place is very Parisian with a french twist . The food is increadible and creative . Money wise this is a good opportunity to eat fine food for a reasonable budget. It is not a tourist place as most of the attendees the day i went were French. This is the place to go. Congrats to the cook!;sept-16;Boutary
2;Brilliant;5.0;Well mannered staff and such a homely place Food was gorgeous was such an easy place to find also;oct-16;Boutary
2;Stunning food and lovely atmosphere;5.0;Visited here for my partner's 40th as a treat. We had the chef's signature menu with caviar royale and paired wines. Every course was beautiful, wines perfectly matched and superb in their own right. The serving staff were friendly and helpful, explaining everything well. They were able to switch to English when our French failed. If you are looking for a special meal then this is the place to go!;oct-16;Boutary
2;Very nice !!!;4.0;Really a nice place, nice dining room, nice people incredibly smiling and willing to share their knowledge about caviar, very delicious and tasty dishes and not only caviar . It is a nice but rather expensive place;oct-16;Boutary
2;A truly special find!;5.0;"My wife and I stumbled upon this hidden gem on a quiet little street of the Left Bank. A warm and welcoming environment, an up-and-coming young chef, a very creative menu--all of those make for an unforgettable dinner experience. Highly recommend their signature dish (""pomme de terre Boutary"") and the peach dessert.";sept-16;Boutary
2;Wonderful meal and service;5.0;Really a great find in this district. Innovative food, warm and friendly service, a well priced wine list and very nicely spaced tables for 2 (a rarity in this area) despite the restaurant not being all that big. Looks like the menu changes daily and they also have a tasting menu. My wife and I had an excellent dining experience and would certainly go back. Not sure why there are so few reviews on trip advisor but don't let that scare you away.;sept-16;Boutary
2;Astonishing restaurant, delicious, colourful, unexpected;5.0;"A very original gourmet experience. A new address with a very innovative and sophisticated cooking. A once-in-a-lifetime opportunity to taste caviar in a relaxed atmosphere. Don't miss the ""Pomme de terre Boutary"" or better the ""Caviarotheque"" with 3 different caviars ! We also had the Cabillaud and Maigre, both great dishes. The wine list is equally exceptional.The owner speaks perfect english and can tell you a lot about food and wine";juil-16;Boutary
2;Greatest romantic diner in Paris !!;5.0;We had the best experience ever in Paris with this scrumptious diner in a warm and cosy environment. The team was very helpful but not intrusive.The food simply divine and beautifully presented.We would love to come back soon and try some other dishes...If you have a sweet tooth like me, you can't miss the Madeleines and the Mousse au chocolat!;juin-16;Boutary
2;Lovely;5.0;This is a sweet, unpretentious place in a neighborhood with many crowded, noisier restaurants. The menu is small but unique and both fish dishes that we ordered were extremely well prepared. We only wished we could have tried more items. The staff was very friendly and gracious in explaining the dishes.;juin-16;Boutary
2;Lovely experience;5.0;We had a very nice evening from the time we walked in. A warm inviting restaurant matched by attentive, well informed friendly staff. We started with the caviar experience which was fantastic. Dinner was innovative, very tasty and well balanced. After the battling the crowds of Paris all day it was a welcome retreat, very peaceful and indulgent experience. Thank you.;juil-16;Boutary
2;A gem on Rue Mazarine;5.0;The service was fabulous as was the food. We received an education in caviar as a bonus! The dishes we ordered were creative, tasty and a wonderful mix of flavours. We would go back back in a heartbeat.;juin-16;Boutary

Ps: try the smokey vodka ... It's a ""must""";avr-16;Boutary
2;A fabulous experience;5.0;An astounding experience in Paris. Caviar at a reasonable price, sumptuous starters showing amazing inventiveness, perfect main courses and delicious deserts. A good wine list with reasonable prices, an excellent selection of champagnes and as one might expect in a caviar themed restaurant, an extensive and interesting choice of vodkas from many places.Coupled with great service an evening to remember.;mars-16;Boutary
3;Delicious entrecôte for 2;5.0;Delicious entrecôte for 2 washed down with a nice rose and a light, bursting with fruit blackberry cream with meringue for afters. Ended with an unusual but crisp/refreshing liqueur called byrrh on the house. Very nice staff and ate at a table in the street due to lockdown - nice quiet street despite the odd moped whizzing through which made for a bizarre Diva-like scene at times.;sept-20;Bistrot Instinct
3;Lovely Bistro Lunch!;5.0;We opted for the lunch menu which worked out at about £20 each for two courses. My cold soup starter was delightful, whilst the main course was absolutely delicious. Portions were average sized, but the food was very tasty and the service and ambiance excellent. A wonderful place for typically French meal.;août-20;Bistrot Instinct
3;Fantastic service, delicious food, highly recommend.;5.0;Really great experience here. Such friendly staff and prompt service with attention to all the details. The menu is wonderful too. We had the cucumber hummus and the rabbit terrine to start. Both were very light, nicely presented and a perfect soft intro to the mains. For the mains we had veal chop which was juicy and delicious with a lovely combination of two sauces, plus vegetables. For the other we had the fillet of fish served on mashed potato with a sprinkling of vegetables around it and an absolutely delicious sauce over it, light and tasty. Both were utterly delicious. One of the waiters paired the veal with a lovely dry white wine too. We indulged in a dessert each and both were great - the profiterole with pistachio icecream in the middle and melted chocolate all around, and the biscuit meringue with raspberry, so nice. The atmosphere was great, the decor comfortable and the experience excellent. Really nice first meal on this Paris trip. Highly recommend. (Tip: Upstairs can get quite hot so if reserving a table it would be a good idea to request one next to the windows).;août-20;Bistrot Instinct
3;Soo good!;5.0;We had such a lovely meal and Bistrot Instinct. The food was presented nicely and tasted even better. The service was excellent and all waiters spoke excellent English. Cannot recommend enough.;août-20;Bistrot Instinct
3;More than expected;5.0;We selected this restaurant based on the good scores from TripAdvisor... And it was even better than expected. The fish was full of flavor thanks to unusual and researched mix of ingredients, entrecote delicious, staff friendly and professional. I look forward to it again.;juil-20;Bistrot Instinct
3;Yummy dinner;5.0;We enjoyed our meal very much. We especially appreciated our server, Lou, who spoke great English, and helped us with the menu. Plus, he was attentive and eager to please. Sat outside on a cute street. Good service and good food.;juil-20;Bistrot Instinct
3;Cool, quirky and excellent food;5.0;Quaint bistro, gave an authentic French feel. Great service & excellent English too!Cost €20/main, approx €35/bottle wine which was recommended to us. Would highly recommend for couples or small groups of friends;mars-20;Bistrot Instinct
3;Simply the best. Extraordinarily;5.0;Simply the best. Extraordinarily delicious food, exquisite service and cosy, friendly atmosphere. A must go for any trip to Paris even if you only have a couple of nights.;mars-20;Bistrot Instinct
3;great service;5.0;went here since it was number 1 on TripAdvisor.the food was good, but the reason it's getting full score is the service.when we asked for place nearby for drinks they did not just give recommendations, but also called the places to check if it was open or full.;janv-20;Bistrot Instinct
3;Pitch perfect;5.0;A lovely new informal contemporary bistro in the Haut Marais. The food is healthy and of great quality, with well-chosen wines available by the glass. It is good value (especially the set menu at lunchtime), and the young waiters are attentive and friendly. Decor and ambiance very agreeable too. Highly recommended within its price range.;mars-20;Bistrot Instinct
3;Relaxing Lunch;5.0;My wife and I went to Bistrot Instinct for lunch based on other TA reviews and we certainly weren't disappointed. The restaurant was busy but we were seated straight away and waited on as if we were the only ones there. The food was incredible, so fresh and tasty, and the price was very reasonable. We left with full bellies and smiles on our faces, both agreeing that we would definitely be back. I would highly recommend Bistrot Instinct to anyone.;févr-20;Bistrot Instinct
3;The TripAdvisor Hype is well deserved;5.0;We were surprised, given the ranking of this restaurant that we were able to book a reservation only several days prior...one of the advantages of going off-season in February. It lived up to the hype. Really amazing food at incredible prices, great atmosphere, solid wine list, attentive and friendly service. Small, but on two floors and we felt very comfortable upstairs. Will be sure to return on our next visit.;févr-20;Bistrot Instinct
3;So glad we had booked....;5.0;We had a wonderful dinner here. Booking was super easy online and as the place was full the night we went I imagine not many groups get in without a booking. We were staying just around the corner and this place felt like an truly authentic French bistro. It was busy but the staff were super attentive. The menu is small but had something for everyone. The food was super tasty - French food at its best.;févr-20;Bistrot Instinct
3;Homely and excellant ambiance with Good foods;5.0;The title says it all and I had an amazing food dining with my family and friends. Small place but the service of the staff was attentive and excellant. Quite limited food selection on the menu but overall highly recommended for dinner dining.;févr-20;Bistrot Instinct
3;Trendy bistro, fabulous food;5.0;I highly recommend this restaurant a stone’s throw from La Place de la Republique. The decor is trendy, the staff very efficient and friendly (with good English if you don’t speak French) and the food is of a very high quality. The menu is not extensive, which I think is a good thing, and there is usually a couple of specials. We turned up on a Tuesday evening and it was full so I would recommend booking in advance, as it’s not a big place. We booked for the next evening and were so impressed we booked again for the following evening. The wine list is a bit pricey but the dishes are good value: about €20 for a main course and €9/€10 for starters and desserts. Bon appetit.;févr-20;Bistrot Instinct
3;Great Restaurant!!;5.0;I really recommend this restaurant!The food is so delicious and the waiters were so kind.We definitely will come back..;janv-20;Bistrot Instinct
3;The best little bistro;5.0;I love this place! I went there based in the previous reviews and am so glad I did. It is a little off the main attractions, but I think it is part of its charm. Not touristy, but they speak English. Amazing food! Not much option, but it is common in a neighborhood bistro. I loved the fish and appetizers I tried.

4;Great experience!;5.0;Pardi is an absolutely gorgeous little place tucked away in the Marché Saint Quentin. We went early for breakfast, which is not the meal they're most geared towards (although they offer croissants, coffee, bread and various other things) - and our experience couldn't have been more excellent. The service in particular was amazing: we asked for strawberry jam with our croissants, but they were out. Not a problem, we would've been content with just butter as well - but no, one of the gents behind the counter disappeared for a while and came back with strawberry jam he seems to have acquired elsewhere on the market for us. Above and beyond, really! That trend continues: one of us wanted a cheese sandwich instead of a croissant. He got to pick the bread he wanted and instead of putting some cheese on and calling it a day, we received an entire cheese platter. They even added some more cheese halfway through the meal. The atmosphere was wonderful, the staff was clearly enjoying themselves and the food and coffee were excellent. The next time I'm in Paris, I'll definitely go back for a long lunch.;mars-20;Pardi
4;Don’t miss out on this delight!;5.0;This little corner shop tucked away is the neighborhood’s best kept secret. Fantastic food for myself and a vegan friend.

4;Wonderful Food Corner in Saint Quentin Market;5.0;Discovered this by chance and went for the veggie burger as the fast and affordable option, with a side of grenaille potatoes. The burger patty was made up of quinoa, bulgur and lentils, and literally oozed into a delicious sea of grain when cut into. Perfect balance with the sauce, cheese, salad and sesame bun.The potatoes where a luxury not needed, the complimentary cranberry walnut bread was more than enough.Friendly, helpful owner and staff, very good English spoken.Worth the detour!;févr-20;Pardi

4;More than excellent!;5.0;Unexpected discovery exploring the market whilst filling in time. Seriously good food chosen from the daily menu and the recommended wine from southern France also wonderful. The chef cooking in a tiny kitchen behind the counter and the young lady waiting on the clients clearly dedicated to producing fine food and service. Spoke with local clients who all eat here regularily.;oct-19;Pardi
4;A gem!;5.0;Dropped into the market on the off chance having been turned away from an allegedly more prestigious cafe because it was 13.45! Warm welcome, innovative dishes, good wine, great ambience. Only 5 mins from Gare du Nord and open 08.00 to 20.30h. The beef' tagliatelle' was thin strips of just seared beef with some spice and beautifully cooked roast potatoes. excellent.;oct-19;Pardi
4;The best meal I had in Paris;5.0;I visited yesterday (3rd May) and I decided to review this as it was the best meal I had during my time in Paris.The ingredients were incredibly fresh, presumably coming from the market in which the restaurant is located. The wine, bread, asparagus starter and beef main were incredibly good. The cheese course was enormous, and they might reduce their size and cost for 1 person. The service was exceptional.;mai-19;Pardi

5;Just go there and enjoy it;5.0;I dine out a lot, all over the world. This new restaurant in Paris ranks right in the top of my experiences. I went for the 7-course menu with 4 paired wines, and finished it off with 1972 Calvados. Don't bother going for less than that! Everything was just wonderful. Inspiring, tasty food prepared and served by a dynamic young team. I counted five different people bringing me the various courses and explaining them. I'll be back.;juil-20;La Table de Colette

5;Excellent food and service;5.0;I was fortunate to dine at La Table de Colette in December 2019 shortly after it opened and enjoyed a 7 course tasting menu with matched wines. I know the front of house Vincent from another restaurant and the standard of his service, attention to detail and efforts to ensure you enjoy the dining experience is first class.Was seated near the kitchen and got to meet the chef and other staff which all combined to make the night memorable as I was dining solo. Highly recommend for those looking for a special night.;déc-19;La Table de Colette

5;Birthday dinner;5.0;Had a wonderful birthday dinner. The staff was incredibly welcoming. Everything was explained so well when each course came out. I chose the 5 course option. I was stuffed. The butter though. My goodness. Would 100% recommend for anyone coming to Paris. The wine selections were great and I was offered something else if I didn’t like was what chosen but the pairings worked so well with the food. Excellent dining experience!

5;Room for improvement;3.0;Thank you for hosting me and my fiance during our stay in Paris especially the night of New Year Eve. Let me explain why this is a 3-star rating because I think this will not be justified without some explanation. First of all, we love the team on the floor - everyone treats us very nice and always passionate and well knowledged for every dish and different kind of wine pairing. During the entire dining experience, we were surprised by a few dishes such as the celery root risotto. However, we do think the fish is a bit overcooked and lost the natural softness of the fish. One key reason we gave a 3-star is probably because of the main dish - because it's a special day (NYE) so I booked ahead of time and informed the team that we're pescatarian (only eat seafood and veggies), and the response was the kitchen is well informed and will adjust for us. However, when the main dish is served, both my fiance and I were a bit of shock. It simply looks like the dish was served with the garnish veggie only. It is identical to the dish on the next table but simply without the steak. To me, this is quite unacceptable for a restaurant that only serves a tasting menu, not to mention the team has informed me that they will adjust to the request a while back. I still think La Table de Colette is still a place to experience because of the service and the knowledge of the food they serve, so I hope this honest feedback will make them even better!;déc-19;La Table de Colette

We went to Paris for only 4 days and we are so happy this was the way we ended our trip. we both love to cook so we were overwhelmed at the presentation and and the food.

The staff was very attentive and plated and utensils moved like a well tuned orchestra. The food was phenomenal and the wine pairing was fantastic.

6;Fanastic food and great service.;5.0;We ate at Pur' in December as part of a 5 night trip to Paris to see the Leonardo Exhibition at the Louvre. We also dined at Epicure, Apicius, Joel Robuchon and L'Ardoise.We had a wonderful meal at Pur'. We had the 6 course tasting menu. Dishes were all interesting with nice Far East influences. The crab dish and the scallops were excellent. We were made very welcome. Given the chance to change our table to allow us to view the kitchen and the chef's final inspection of each dish. We thoroughly recommend this restaurant for excellent food, service and value for money (expensive but very much worth it).If interested Pur' and Apicius were our favourite restaurants. Slightly disappointed with Robuchon and even more so with Epicure. We had been to L' Adoise 3 years ago and it did not disappoint on our return.;déc-19;Pur' - Jean-François Rouquette
6;Service as extraordinary as the food;5.0;On entering the dining room, we were struck by the soft pleated folds of the fabric walls echoing the restaurant’s location on the elite fashion street Blvd St Honore. Then we were welcomed by our charming server Guillaume who turned out to be the best we’ve had in any top restaurant in the world. And the sommelier Julia recommended a truly superb wine that was less pricey than the original wine we requested that was not available. This exceptional service was matched by a meal full of delicious inventive dishes including several light foam creations. The dark chocolate dessert was so spectacular i hardly dared to eat it but it was as delicious as it was beautiful. Truly a magical dining experience in all dimensions!;déc-19;Pur' - Jean-François Rouquette
6;An exceptional restaurant;5.0;I booked this Michelin star restaurant for my boyfriends birthday and everything was perfect. Excellent customer service even before we had arrived. After I mentioned about our birthday celebration they wanted to make sure that we had an amazing time.We got their 8 courses tasting menu with wine pairing and in addition to this their lobster dish. Each dish was perfectly seasoned and cooked and very well presented. The service was excellent. The staff was very attentive and very helpful.When we visit Paris again we are definitely going to dine at this beautiful restaurant and most likely going to stay at their beautiful hotel as well. If we could give more stars we would, because this was the best Michelin star restaurant we have been to.Thank you for making our special day very special.;déc-19;Pur' - Jean-François Rouquette
6;Pure haute cuisine;5.0;The place is inside Hyatt. Extremely posh and expensive but for sure worth a visit. This is a gastronomic experience of a different level you unlikely to experience in your everyday life. The restaurant does not have windows - may be because view through the window may interfere with clients dining experience. When we arrived (8 pm) the place was almost empty but in one hour all tables were occupied though it was a regular Tuesday night. We did not go for the set menu neither did we go for wine pairing and decided to order a la carte. The food is excellent. It is not actually the dishes that we selected that excited us the most - it is the chef complements - they are amazing. Frankly I do not know how they do it - this is not food processing, this is food art. The price corresponds with the level of service and food quality - I guess that was the largest bill I ever paid for a meal for two. If you can afford it, go for it without hesitation.;nov-19;Pur' - Jean-François Rouquette

The service was excellent, our water glasses were never left empty and we never had to wait more than a few minutes between courses. The food was delicious and full of interesting flavours and combinations, and the portion sizes were surprisingly large given the number of courses. They even gave us a treat to take home with us at the end. The ambiance was very elegant and calm, creating a pleasant and relaxing atmosphere.;nov-19;Pur' - Jean-François Rouquette
6;Great dinner at Pur;5.0;The experience was worth every penny, this is among the best places I’ve ever had a meal. Having one Michelin star raises the expectations, but the restaurant’s crew delivered. Every dish was wonderful. We decided on the 6 course menu and opted out of the champagne and wine package, as it is too much to drink for us (and saves you 1/3 of the price), but had a couple of glasses of wine each instead.Overall a very satisfying experience, I would go there again given the opportunity.;oct-19;Pur' - Jean-François Rouquette

The presentation was excellent. I barely wanted to eat the food (just sit and look at it). We had two waiters, and a female server for our drinks. Everyone was extremely friendly and attentive, thoroughly and patiently answering any questions, given our very limited French. The atmosphere is really classy, with a more contemporary style, but still, that French ambiance. My mom can't stop talking about her experience, and why should she? It was amazing!

6;Superb service, delicious food, and sublime experience at the Chef's tasting table;5.0;We stayed at the Park Hyatt for 3 nights during our trip to France. My birthday happened to fall during our stay and we tried to get a table online but the restaurant was showing as fully booked. We emailed the hotel and they were able to confirm a reservation for us just a few nights before. Imagine our surprise when we showed up for dinner and the wonderful maitre d' escorted us to the Chef's table! We did the 7 course tasting with wine pairing but we couldn't keep track of what number we were on, very quickly. (There were so many extras!) I have some dietary limitations which the chef was able to work around, seemingly easily. With the entire kitchen on show, it was a delightful experience though very intimate at the chef's table. We were already impressed and pleased with every course that came out but when the Wagyu beef course came out- I may have cried some tears of joy because it was perfection in my mouth. I even halted the chef to tell him how amazing it was in the middle of the course. Every pairing was a classic match to the dominant flavors of each dish. The cheese course was just ridiculous. In the sheer quantity and selection. Delicious but that quantity is rough on the stomach of non French diners. The madelines and after dinner pastry they offered to pack up to have the next morning (we were so full!) and we were thankful we did!!! Those madelines were better than any other madeline I had ever had and that snail shell was perfectly executed laminated dough.We are no strangers to multi course fine dining in NYC. This is the classic French dining experience and this was executed perfectly.;sept-19;Pur' - Jean-François Rouquette
6;Not Simple But Certainly the BEST!;5.0;First the food is far beyond wonderful. Second, the quality of service matches the food. Truly excellent! We had a truly „Lifetime Event“ dinner here on 15 September 2019. We had 6 in our party from Europe and the United States. The decor and atmosphere are stunning but not overwhelming. We felt as if we were in a nice warm home for a gourmet meal. We chose the Escape 6 course menu with wine pairing. Every single item was superb in presentation, taste, texture and overall marriage of flavors. The service was also truly „World Class“ The Chef, Jean François Rouquette is a honest to gosh genius and his team of Chefs make him shine even more! I can go on but you have to experience dinner here for yourself. It’s that awesome! Bravo!;sept-19;Pur' - Jean-François Rouquette

6;Enchanted!;5.0;We enjoyed a delightful meal here last night. The entire experience was a 10...from the moment we arrived. We had the The Diary menu which was 8 courses.My husband matched the wines. Each course was delightful and an explosion of flavours.A culinary delight to savour. The service was kind and beautiful as well ad classy and discreet.Definitely one of the 10 experiences. My only criticisms are that there is not nearly enough protein in the main steak dish as I felt the portion was just too tiny. I was very hungry - and had to have extra bread. The other one was that the olive oil around the dessert made it quite bitter - probably not the best taste sensation but the strawberry and rhubarb dessert was sublime.The beautiful lady at the front gave us a gift when we left - some little cakes which was a lovely touch. Expect to pay a small fortune but it's a wonderful experience. Thank you;juin-19;Pur' - Jean-François Rouquette
6;Always a very special treat;5.0;Every year when we visit Paris we try to delight ourselves with a dinner at Pur’. It’s always a wonderful experience, we enjoy the special treatment and attention of the perfectly trained staff, we selected the 6 dishes menu with wine pairing. Every dish was fine, exquisite and beautifully presented. The atmosphere is elegant and calm. It’s a fine dining experience with a price tag on it but absolutely worth it. We will come back next year again, for sure.;juin-19;Pur' - Jean-François Rouquette

6;Absolutely perfect in every way!;5.0;The restaurant Pur’ at Park Hyatt Paris Vendôme is a haven of cosy elegance tucked away a few steps from glamorous Place Vendôme.We were warmly welcomed by all the staff and placed at the VIP table overlooking the kitchen. If I had to pick up a single word to sum up this experience of a lifetime it would be PERFECT. For that’s exactly how it was, from the attentive yet friendly service to the succession of exquisitely prepared and savory dishes: stuffed morels with Iranian lemon, ‘shiabu’ style foie gras and tiny langoustine ravioli to start with, followed by an extraordinary barbecued blue lobster tail with jalapeños, dried apricots and crispy asparagus. As for dessert, the chef had especially made a mango and citrus birthday cake very elegantly decorated with gold leaf and a golden chocolate tag wishing my younger son Adam a Happy Birthday!;avr-19;Pur' - Jean-François Rouquette

We decided to really treat ourselves and had the 8 course tasting menu with the wine pairing. The food was out of this world amazing!!

6;Very special;5.0;We reserved a table for my daughter’s birthday( the evening before) . Everything was well organized in advance - confirming requirements and restrictions and special requirements to make the evening special. The service was outstanding and the food was truly memorable. We had the 6 course menu - each course was masterful. My only regret? That we had to hasten towards the end and miss the last dessert so we could get home before midnight to uncork champagne for the birthday girl. We’ll head back sometime in the next months to make sure we make up for that !;avr-19;Pur' - Jean-François Rouquette
6;Superb, Michelin need to think about adding another star;5.0;I am comparing this to other 1 Michelin star restaurant but this is difficult as I feel that this should have two stars, so if I’m being picky I’m really comparing this to 2 or 3 star places. Arrived at the restaurant and excellent front of house staff led us to table, handing off smoothly on the way. We ordered cocktails, an Amigo fashioned which was sweet and delicious and a Roasted Toni which was nice but the bar is far away so we had the amuse Bouche and bread before the drinks arrived. In a perfect world these would have been held back until the drinks arrived. The Amuse Bouche were outstanding. Chef had made alterations for my mint and seafood allergy, but the Mexican tortilla with guacamole and the hint of heat should be a staple. The Pre starter was superb and the asparagus and foam was a good improvisation. We ordered the ‘As Time goes by’ menu with a single wine flight to share. The menu consisted of duck foie gras, monkfish, bresse chicken, cheese cream, pineapple dessert, chocolate dessert, coffee. Wine for first course went well and married with the raspberry and cut the pate feel out of the mouth. Crispy fried onion in the foie Gras and the raspberry were unexpected but a great flavour combination giving you a sweet and tart hit. The noodle had no taste, just adding a nice texture as the foie gras was quite creamy. Second wine no bouquet and flat.Unfortunately Chef had provided an asparagus Pre starter for me and I had more asparagus for second course while my partner had the monkfish, which was superb. The asparagus was nice but having just eaten asparagus it was not great to have more. However Chef realised his mistake and we had a bonus course of Waygu beef as an apology, which was a very generous offer. A simple spoon of granita as a palate cleanser was a lovely touch. Then Bresse chicken. We had looked forward to this but unfortunately the smell of Waygu beef was in the restaurant (while smelling amazing, this meant the chicken could not be smelt properly). However the taste of the chicken and how it had been treated and dressed with morels was exquisite. Full of flavour, a wonderful mouth feel of rich tender flesh complemented by the carefully stuffed skin. A triumph of cooking and worth coming for by itself. We then tried the Waygu, it was delightful and handled well but still the Bresse chicken for me was the better main. The Brie cheese cream was next and chef had managed to pack it full of flavour while keeping a light silkiness that filled the mouth with a tingle and an earthy fullness of flavour. Two desserts followed. The first was a pineapple and coffee for my partner which she devoured in moments. I had a Granny Smith and beer desert that was tart and rich and quite simply a masterpiece from the pastry chef. They should really make this their signature dish. We finished with the chocolate smash that contained olive oil and an olive oil ice cream. Added to the menu yesterday this was a sweet and salty finish that was a delightful pairing with the wine (almost like a olorosso sherry)A brioche with chantilly cream rounded off a 3 hour supper that was exquisite overall. Staff are on the ball and friendly and they seem to know the menu very well providing excellent overview of the food presented and superb service, managed adroitly by Camille (the manager). Service is almost impeccable, just below Le Gavroche, which to me is the gold standard and better than Alain Ducasse at the Dorchester and any other place I have eaten. You really need to see how much more you enjoy food when it’s served and you’re looked after to this standard. It makes the meal!Overall I would recommend that Michelin take a strong hard look at their award of a single star for this endeavour as it seems to be less than it deserves. Staff and Chef are worthy of at least one more star if they fix the venting for the grill so the smell of steak doesn’t permeate the restaurant when it’s dropped to the grill and quite possibly 3 if they fix the challenges I felt they had on the wine flight (excluding starter, bresse and chocolate desserts, which were very good matches). I’d rate this in the top 2 of the 25 Michelin restaurants we’ve been to in the last 2 and a bit years. Next time in Paris, it’s the first on my list to visit.;avr-19;Pur' - Jean-François Rouquette
6;Fine Dining by the Opera;5.0;Excellent food and attentive service at this Michelin starred restaurant walking distance from the Opera Metro stop. In the Hyatt hotel. Very creative and delicious food. Romantic ambience. A bit expensive, but worth it for a unique dining experience.;avr-19;Pur' - Jean-François Rouquette
6;One of the finest restaurants we ever dined in;5.0;The above says it all. The food is amazing, small portions, but with a multitude of flavors. Hitting the palate from every angle the dinner unfolded with impeccable service and a lovely ambiance. I cannot say enough about this wonderful experience;mars-19;Pur' - Jean-François Rouquette
6;Birthday trip to Paris - set menu with matching wine;5.0;Wow, words can't describe how wonderful this was and how much fun my partner and i had.My partner surprised me with this dinner, and it was superb. My partner and i aren't complete foodies we enjoy our food but aren't Michelin star hunters and i think the staff appreciated that we were asking questions, listening to how they choice the wine etc and the i think the staff really appreciated this as we were totally involved.I cannot fault this place, thank you for making my 26th birthday incredible!;oct-18;Pur' - Jean-François Rouquette
6;Impeccable service;4.0;The reservation process through tripadvisor was very easy and the confirmation was received within minutes.I wish I could give 10 stars to the service as it was truly exceptional, everything was really perfect. We ordered from the menu and the dishes were beautifully presented and the portions were adequate. However, I must point out that the flavors of the food were not as exceptional as I was expecting. The foie gras was truly exceptional with a flavor and texture I have never tried before but the rest of the plates were very good.The sommelier was also amazing and she gave very good pairing suggestions.The cheese table was amazing with great recommendations from Ms Camille.;mars-19;Pur' - Jean-François Rouquette
6;Amazing experience;5.0;An amazing experience for me and my wife, it was all delicious, highlights for me were the chicken, scallops and pineapple with coffee desert. It was made special with exceptional service.;mars-19;Pur' - Jean-François Rouquette
6;Superb;5.0;We dined at many wonderful restaurants in Paris, many of which were more budget friendly yet still excellent. Pur was the best dining experience of our trip and quite possibly our lives. We did the 6 course menu. We started with champagne and were served complimentary appetizers. The attention to detail was spectacular. The staff was young, excited, and attentive. We have dined at multiple Michelin restaurants. I could not recommend this place more. Superb.;mars-19;Pur' - Jean-François Rouquette
6;Pure delight;5.0;Excellent service, prompt and attentive. Nice ambience and decor. Very refined food with exciting flavour combinations. Particularly noteworthy were the scallops with a Mexican twist and the chocolate and cherry dessert. Super!;févr-19;Pur' - Jean-François Rouquette
6;Amazing menu in a romantic setting;5.0;My wife wanted to celebrate her birthday here because of the romantic setting. Had to book ahead quite a bit, the process was great, as I asked for a birthday cake for my wife, I got a very fast response from the team there, we worked through what I wanted, and 48 hours before the dinner I was asked to confirm again.The dinner was amazing, we had the ‘as time goes by’ menu, I loved everything, amazing taste experience. Service was outstanding, and the cake at the end both beautiful and delicious. My wife loved every minute, thank you to the team at pur!;févr-19;Pur' - Jean-François Rouquette
6;Six Courses of Perfection;5.0;We visited Pur for dinner on a January Saturday evening. Every dish offered in the six course tasting menu from amuse bouche to second dessert was perfection on a plate. The wine pairings were really carefully matched and every one of them worked. The service was at our pace, friendly and attentive. We cannot recall enjoying a dinner as much as this - ever.;janv-19;Pur' - Jean-François Rouquette
6;It was good but ...;4.0;We've booked the restaurant a half year in advance and I must say that our expectations were really high. Generally, it was a pleasent evening but I do not really think that all my expectations were completely fulfilled.Now, some details. After a pleasent welcome and brief hello from chef, we took a glass of champagne and our 6-course menu started. As we are a big wine lovers, we took a menu with wine pairing. The first meal was a crab meat in a small ravioli. With a second bite, I hit a part of crab shell which is really very unpleasent. After couple of seconds, my wife had a same problem (so this was not a unique case). Very honestly, I would not expect such mistake in restaurant on this level. We received a Maconnais white Burgundy to this course and a wine was a disapointment. So, our start was not very good. With a second course, we received pan fried scallops and those were really awesome. Accompanied with white Bordeaux, this was really excellent and returned mood at table back where it should be. Third course was a decent stuffed chicken (still nothing really special), served with a glass of Le Clementin du Chateau Pape Clement 2012. Although from a poor vintage, this was far the best wine we had the evening. After a cheese, we received two deserts and both were great. I am not so much about sweet stuff but especialy citrus fruit desert was probably one of best desert I've ever tasted.So, while overall, this was a nice evening, it must be said that we paid 535 € for two persons. I had a comparable menu in couple restaurants where price was around 300 €. Yes, we are in a heart of Paris so +100 € but that is still around 400 € and I just have a hard time to justify that remaining hounderd. Probably the biggest weakness was a service. Too many trivial mistakes like serving food from wrong side or quite a lack of comunication with guest.Long story short, this was a nice evening, no questions about that. But it was just nice, not great, not perfect. And for the price we paid, I am just not sure.;janv-19;Pur' - Jean-François Rouquette
6;Great experience;5.0;My family and I enjoyed a wonderful night at Pur'. We were greeted nicely by the Hotel front doorman and escorted to the restaurant, seated with a great table and had a wonderful first impression. We were with my two young kids. The staff was excellent toward the kids, treating them nicely and offering them pillows on the bench, juice, etc. They had a very very nice kids menu. I love seeing these type of restaurants with options for kids, which keeps them happy and allows the adults to have a good night too. We had the Christmas Dinner menu with wine pairing. Excellent dishes. Only item of notice was the chicken main course. it was very good, but thought maybe chicken was a bit too easy for this type of restaurant. At the end of the day. Well priced and excellent quality. Had a great time. Highly recommend!;déc-18;Pur' - Jean-François Rouquette
6;Fantastic food!;5.0;Pur is an amazing restaurant! The food tastes delicious and the creativity of the courses is incredible. the staff is kind, attentive and friendly. The atmosphere is great. The only thing that wasn’t perfect was the coffee (unfortunately from an automatic coffee machine) but it’s just a little thing. The restaurant still deserves 10/10!;janv-19;Pur' - Jean-François Rouquette

6;Almost perfect;5.0;We had dinner here on a Saturday night and opted for the Passing Time 6 course menu. Service was lovely, wine list was extensive, food was wonderful. We were seated at a table in the rotunda, which was very elegant. Everything was perfect except we waited a long time to get our check. Probably not a long time by Parisian standards, but definitely by American standards. They seemed to be having trouble with their credit card processing machine and apologized about it. Aside from that, this was a lovely meal and I think they deserve their Michelin star.;nov-18;Pur' - Jean-François Rouquette

6;Everything was perfect;5.0;We ate dinner here for our 7th wedding anniversary, and our experience was amazing from start to finish. Everyone on the staff was wonderful and delivered exceptional service. Every course of the tasting menu was delicious -- the dessert courses were particularly divine. And the sommelier selected excellent wines to pair with our meal.Pur' is more than deserving of its 1-star Michelin rating, and we look forward to returning again next time we're in Paris. Thank you for such a wonderful evening!;oct-18;Pur' - Jean-François Rouquette
6;50th Birthday surprise from the good lady;5.0;6 course taster plus wine pairing simply stunning. Sublime flavours with the pomp and ceremony to accompany such flair. I asked for a french description of each meal with an English translation for my wife Impecable from all staff. Even the striking union protestors lapping the restaurant with flags high vis vests and placards added to the experience Felt thoroughly spoiled;oct-18;Pur' - Jean-François Rouquette
6;Fantastic service, great food!;5.0;Wife and I along with another couple were at Pur in October. The staff was absolutely wonderful! could not have been better. Cyrille even recommended other restaurants for us in Florence, Italy, where we were headed next.;oct-18;Pur' - Jean-François Rouquette
6;Chefs table special event;5.0;The restaurant were notified of my allergy issues a couple of weeks in advance to establish whether the chef was prepared to adjust set menu to allow for my problems. I had a fantastic meal eating things I would never have risked before worrying if there was a ingredient included I had problems with eating.;oct-18;Pur' - Jean-François Rouquette
6;Good food overshadowed by bad service.;3.0;Typically i wouldn't let the service at a restaurant ruin perfectly good dining on a lovely summer evening out with my husband. However Pur' did just that. I find the Parisian service culture second to none and thus was appalled over the condescending, blatenly rude mannerisms, on several occasions, by our garcon. It got to the point where i just stopped responding to him and let my husband talk for me. By the end of the meal he was fine but it was too late-- he overshadowed the food.;juil-18;Pur' - Jean-François Rouquette
6;A meal for the ages;5.0;We went to PUR as part of our week celebrating our honeymoon. By far, PUR was THE BEST meal and may be one of the best meals we’ve ever experienced. The staff was incredible - attentive but not intrusive. Camille was the best server ever - helpful and informed and so kind. And the food...simply stellar. The room is spectacular - we had the tasting menu which was amazing. We loved it!;oct-18;Pur' - Jean-François Rouquette
6;A Memorable Meal;5.0;Restaurant Pur' is a Michelin star rated restaurant located in the Park Hyatt Hotel near the Palais Royal. My wife and I had dinner there to celebrate a 40th anniversary. The food and wine pairings were excellent. Unless you are an expert on French wines, I strongly suggest letting them pick the wines. They are very good. The wait staff was attentive and helpful and spoke English. This is a fairly expensive dinner experience, but worth it.;oct-18;Pur' - Jean-François Rouquette
6;A Perfect Birthday Dinner;5.0;We had a wonderful dinner at Pur, the best of our trip to Paris! We had booked a table online several weeks before and were promptly contacted by the restaurant since a credit card deposit was required. Despite this, we were again contacted a few days before the reservation with a request to confirm again. This was to celebrate a birthday and we were also asked to confirm whether a cake would be required and what type. So very good customer service even before we arrived.The restaurant is absolutely beautiful, (located in Vendome), and we were seated immediately. This is a fine dining, not a casual restaurant and the atmosphere was perfect for the occasion. Not loud, but not one of those restaurants where you are afraid to have a good time. Unbelievable amount of staff and so we were well attended to, and everyone was really friendly and efficient. We did the tasting menu with wine pairing which was not overwhelming as some of these experiences can be. Compared to the cost of some other restaurants in Paris, the price was not bad especially in such beautiful surroundings and with such attentive staff. The food was delicious. Good sommelier who was a young French American . He took his time to explain the wines and also chatted with us a bit. This was one of my best dining experiences anywhere and I am so happy we picked it for our special celebration. It was perfect!;sept-18;Pur' - Jean-François Rouquette

6;French grace and cordiality;5.0;A wonderful meal at a beautiful restaurant. We started with glasses of premium vintage Champagne. Normally the restaurant only serves a ‘prix fixe menu’ to the whole table, but our hostess permitted us to vary that at our table of four. She also substituted a couple of dishes for my wife who doesn’t eat shellfish (even the chicken dish had a broth of razor clams), and served her wagyu beef that she thinks is the best she’s ever had. The parade of courses (my friend and I had the 8-course menu) was flawless. Each delicious. We selected the wine option and were not disappointed by the selections. Definitely the way to go and worth it. At the end, our hostess, Camille, comped us on the Champagne we drank as an aperitif!! Lovely, friendly people who accommodated our every desire.;sept-18;Pur' - Jean-François Rouquette
6;AMAZING EXPERIENCE;5.0;This was a our first time in a Michelin star restaurant and this place is just amazing, everybody from the restaurant just made us feel like king and queen of the world. The attention, service, the conversation were just wonderful. We had the 6 courses dinner paired with wines and every plate was a perfectly match with the wine and the courses  were brought in such an order that it set perfectly for our taste. This dinner made a big deal in our vacation to Paris. Merci beaucoup!;sept-18;Pur' - Jean-François Rouquette

6;Tasting menu with wine;5.0;"Pleasantly surprised to get a booking same day - especially on a Sunday when many Paris restaurants are closed. We must have got the last table as it was full. Lovely and innovative cocktails in the bar to start and then decided on the full monty tasting menu. First restaurant I've been to in a long while that has menus ""for the lady"" without prices on them!Service was almost flawless throughout, but there were a couple of minor things like them forgetting the beer I ordered - they did remember eventually but by then it was too late. Lots of staff an all worked well together. Everything was delicious and well presented and by the end we were well an truly stuffed - despite being really hungry having been in Paris for a 16KM race, so we were definitely hungry when we got there.Not cheap, but I'd say worth it.";sept-18;Pur' - Jean-François Rouquette
6;French food with a twist;5.0;Everything was really good in here ! We ordered the “ trip diary “ which was an 8 course menu . The foie gras shabu style was probably my favourite the foie gras was melt in your mouth and love the noodles with it . We had the fig dessert which wasn’t really our thing as we don’t really like fig and they apologise by offering us a glass of champagne but of course not their fault as we just don’t like fig ! Will definitely come back the food was spectacular and the waitresses and everyone serving us was wondering !;sept-18;Pur' - Jean-François Rouquette
6;As good as it gets;5.0;We visited Pur for our wedding anniversary. There's nothing not to like in this place, excellent ambience, well trained staff with state of the art service and really nice food.Given the plethora of awarded restaurants in Paris, Pur is a great place combining quality, ambience and a unique experience.;sept-18;Pur' - Jean-François Rouquette
6;Wow!;4.0;We decided to make a reservation because it was a two Michelin star restaurant at the Park Hyatt where we were staying and we were too tired to go out. I should mention that we took our 8 1/2 year old with us. The highlight was that the staff who was very attentive, accommodating, and personable. They met all our needs with a smile and made sure we enjoyed the experience. Now the food. They started by offering a choice of champagne: Pierre Trichet cuvee 1333. Incredible. It's not available in the US, which is very disappointing. The wine list is extensive and very good. We shared two appetizers which were very good and the main courses were phenomenal. You will not have much room for dessert but you should do your best to have some because it is good! Overall, a great experience and quite reasonably priced.;août-18;Pur' - Jean-François Rouquette
6;Jiust beautiful;4.0;The food is so good the service was second to non and my feelings are warm all over.One thing take a big credit card with you. Wine prices are out of control and I told them so. This was why only 4 stars.;juin-18;Pur' - Jean-François Rouquette
6;Our dining experience;5.0;Pur was a magical night for my wife and I from the moment we arrived. The staff are friendly and attentive. My wife and I had the Trip Diary with wine.

Thank you Pur for making our visits memorable one.;juil-18;Pur' - Jean-François Rouquette

6;Fabulous Fun Meal;5.0;We did the 6 course meal offered and it was outstanding!! Free appetizers and each course had magnificent flavors and were very unique with signature French sauces. We even got 2 extra desserts! Very good. Only caution, be prepared to pay $500 euros for dinner with wine.;juil-18;Pur' - Jean-François Rouquette
6;A foodie's dream come true! Expensive, but the 8 course dinner w/ wine pairing is amazing!;5.0;This can be very hard to get in to, but since we were staying the street, we dropped in and asked to be placed on the waiting list. Lo and behold, we did get in .-)We opted for the 8 course meal, which is expensive, and the wine pairing adds on, but this is a case where the food, the service and the pure art of the presentation are actually worth it!This meal will take just over 3 hours to complete, so plan accordingly, or opt for the 6 course version.What is very nice is that you can have input on the courses, or opt for the chef's choice.For us, this was an amazing, once in a lifetime experience. A foodie's dream come true!;juin-18;Pur' - Jean-François Rouquette
6;Fantastic Dinner at Pur to Wrap Up Paris Trip;5.0;We had a delightful dinner at Pur to celebrate the last night of a fun-filled sisters trip to Paris. The 6 course tasting menu was beautifully presented, the service was attentive and gracious, and the food was delicious! Pacing of the meal was great, and the gratis appetizer, amuse Boucher and pre-dessert made the 6 course dinner a 9 course one! We were comfortably seated in a banquette which promoted a more intimate, private dining experience which allowed us to be silly, laugh, and fully enjoy ourselves. Many thanks to Cyrille Combin, Pur Supervisor, and his team for a lovely, memorable meal, and we look forward to our next visit!;mai-18;Pur' - Jean-François Rouquette

6;Very good food, although a few issues;4.0;We had the 8 course menu with wine accompaniment. The food was excellent.You need to book and reconfirm your booking - which makes sense to avoid empty tables when the restaurant is popular. I replied to an email confirming my reservation, but the following day received a call (after a missed call a couple of hours earlier) advising me that my reservation had been cancelled as I had not reconfirmed. Fortunately, upon indicated that I had confirmed by email my reservation was honoured - but not the sort of mix up you expect from a professorial establishment.The meal was very good, but not outstanding.The wait staff all very pleasant and attentive, but away from the table there was a sense that they were rushing around all the time, which was not entirely necessary. Chose the wine accompaniment as I appreciate having wine paired for particular food. However, for one glass I had a load of sediment in the bottom - this is not what I expect when served by a sommelier. In my wife’s desert she had a piece of baking paper - also not what expect in this type of restaurant.It was an enjoyable meal but with a few minor issues and room for improvement.;mai-18;Pur' - Jean-François Rouquette
6;The best meal overall. Ever!;5.0;This was an experience from the moment you walked to the Maitre'd station to when you are seated. Welcomed by friendly, attentive staff that make it seem like a dance. The menu is a culinary experience I will never forget. We pared the courses with the chefs suggested wines. Great way to go. I'm not a big white wine fan, but the pairings were dead on and I never regretted following this chef's choices. Food has to be experienced.;mai-18;Pur' - Jean-François Rouquette
6;Beautiful dinner in Paris;5.0;We recently had the pleasure of dining at Pur' for our last dinner in Paris before we traveled to Lyon. We chose the six course tasting menu with wine pairings and thoroughly enjoyed every course. The service was excellent and the staff was very accommodative of our lack of expertise in French. I would recommend this restaurant to anyone who wishes to experience a truly exquisite dining experience.;mai-18;Pur' - Jean-François Rouquette
6;An exceptional restaurant;5.0;"This is a really exceptional restaurant. The staff are the perfect mix of friendly and formal and were obviously both keen to please and proud of what was being produced. The young female sommelier was particularly knowledgeable and charming: we had the full 8 course tasting menu (Trip Diary) with the accompanying wine and she wrote out a list of the wines for us. The food was exquisite: inventive and interesting without crossing the border into unnecessarily ""adventurous"". Highlights were a delicious asparagus panna cotta with tarragon that was simply essence of asparagus, a foie gras ""like a shabu shabu"" cooked in rhubarb broth and a superb piece of turbot with herbs, wild garlic, paradise seeds and blood orange. The cheese board was a very good one: it avoided the mistake of too many cheeses, and all were served in a perfect condition. The accompanying wines were all well matched, particularly a 2016 Condrieu with abalone and artichoke. We hope to return soon. In fact, i think with various additions, it was in fact about 11 courses but it was well judged in terms of content and portion size.";mai-18;Pur' - Jean-François Rouquette
6;Why we go to Paris...;5.0;To eat exquisite French food. I had the smallest (5 course ) tasting menu which of course expanded with several amuse and several desserts. Each dish was beautifully prepared and presented and the wine pairings were spot on. I was even served a cider which was one of my favorite pairings. The service was the perfect blend of formal and friendly. The meal was about $275 and worth every cent. The room is comfortable and even with a large party felt private and suitable quiet.;avr-18;Pur' - Jean-François Rouquette
6;Must experience;5.0;We’ve been to quite a few Michelin restaurants in Paris now and this has been my favorite. Every detail was perfection. We ordered the 6 course tasting menu - it ended up being 9 courses with the extras they threw in. The beef, chocolate desserts, brioche, and cheeses were standout amazing but the entire experience was top notch. They change the menu out seasonally so we will absolutely be back. Highly recommend.;mai-18;Pur' - Jean-François Rouquette
6;So worth it;5.0;We did not regret having my birthday dinner here. The service was seamless and the atmosphere is elegant. We also liked the menu which had a nice selection of fish and meat. We thoroughly enjoyed our experience.;mai-18;Pur' - Jean-François Rouquette

6;outstanding value and tasting menu;5.0;I flew to Paris for the singular reason of eating top class cuisine. I did my homework and was very selective as to who offered the best. It was not easy but PUR was a standout for its stunning and perfect tasting menu. Rated as a Michelin 1* I feel it should be 2*, I felt it was better than some 3* and a far better value.The tasting menu had greater variety than any I had seen,,, Abalone in seaweed with a Chardonnay sauce, Perfect chicken with morels, Pyrenees Spring Lamb ,Roast Tubot, and Caviar with a panacotta, Duck Foi Gras .... during a delightful 2.5 hours. enjoyable 3 course desert so counting the 3 amuse+ the 3 deserts+ the 6 main courses add wine and it comes to a very reasonable 160 Euros. without wine. Which is pretty cheap when many menu's are in the 370-470 range..  Based on what you get for your Euro/dollar,PUR is fantastic..The kitchen is an open style and you can observe the brigade at work. Excellent technical mastery and presentation of texture, color and taste.... Hey Abalone, In France.... Nobody has done this anywhere but PUR... The Chef has passion and creativity. This is not tourist grand cuisine this is the future . The ambiance and style is semi modern and elegant. I dined by my self and the staff treated me with extreme warmth and friendly/not aloof...even funny..If you are serious about quality cuisine and serious dining then Pur is the bargain of Paris... I say this after some 5 trips to France to dine over 30 years.  If your looking for a original menu and great service.....head to PUR by the Opera. in the 8th I considered it to be in the top 15 restaurants in all of Paris and I have been to a few from Jamin and Tour de Argent in the past to L'Astrance.;avr-18;Pur' - Jean-François Rouquette
6;The Perfect Choice!;5.0;My husband and I decided to kick off our 30th wedding anniversary celebrations by going to Paris and having dinner at Pur. It was an excellent choice indeed! Right from the start it was a smooth and hassle free experience - I booked by email. always prompt and very polite replies, no hitches, extremely satisfactory communications. On the day, we walked from our hotel on Place des Pyramides, by the Louvre, to Pur, just off Place Vendome, a pleasant walk on a mild Spring evening - as you can see, the restaurant is situated in one of the loveliest areas in Paris. As soon as we stepped into the lobby we were taken care of and pampered from start to finish. Our coats were taken to a cloakroom. We were given a table in the centre of the colonnaded structure - it was perfect! Suffice to say I was offered a cushion for my back since I sat on the sofa, even getting to choose the size of the cushion! This was a great idea as I was comfortable throughout the meal and could then relax back onto the sofa for coffee, very thoughtful indeed. A small stool was provided promptly too, for placing bags and phones etc on it instead of cluttering the table. The service was excellent, can't praise the staff enough. They were attentive, obliging and efficient all evening, timing and pace of the meal just right and it was as if they were taking us on a wonderful culinary journey. Our servers explained everything about every course - what ingredients were being used, their provenance and how they were prepared, Same for the wines offered, which were all lovely wines too. The cuisine was divine, just what we were looking for, creative and innovative, far from the usual fare. Every morsel was bursting with flavour, a blend of ingredients brought together in perfect harmony, a work of art, both in taste and presentation. After every course we were left anticipating with pleasure the next one, to find out what delicious creation the chef was coming up with. Our servers made it perfect by explaining every step - the sommelier would inform you that the wine served would be for the one course or for the next two courses and so on. Mind you, there was no need to make the wine last if it was to be served with two courses, because top ups were offered - very nice touch. Also, for instance, the sommelier would say this is the first dessert wine for this evening, so you would automatically infer that there will be another dessert wine served with the second dessert. The ritual was perfect, plates removed, new cutlery, new glasses, then new wine and soon after the new course. Fresh bread was offered throughout, crumbs were removed from the table all the time. We had the Carnet de Voyage, an 8 course menu, with wine pairing. I cannot decide which course was the best - they were all fabulous! Besides the courses on the menu we were given a variety of amuse bouche, which did just that, tantalise the taste buds, making us anticipate what the main meal would be like, since they were excellent. I must mention especially, since it is a favourite of mine, the foie gras - heavenly preparation of this unique ingredient I look forward to when in Paris - it was by far the best I've had here, which is saying something seeing that I try to eat it every day when in Paris. We really enjoyed the cheese course, three very nice and different cheeses. Both desserts were lovely but the chocolate dessert out of this world good, perfectly balanced! Portions are of course of a manageable size to enable you to savour and enjoy each and every one of them. Last of all, and not part of the 8 course menu, with hands in gloves, our server brought us an exquisite treat - a conical shell shaped brioche, which he cut in four and served with the most delicious creme chantilly! The brioche was delightful even on its own! And a chocolate truffle with the coffee too. We really appreciated the service of all the members of staff and of course the culinary prowess of the chef and his team. As a final observation, I received an email from the Pur supervisor, thanking us for choosing Pur - it was a personalised email, even wising us a safe trip to our country, by name - a nice final touch too. We have been to some quite expensive Michelin restaurants in Paris - I have found my favourite this time! I have only two misgivings, that the dinner finally came to an end and that I don't live in Paris! However Pur has given us one more very good reason to return to Paris again and again.;avr-18;Pur' - Jean-François Rouquette
6;Celebrate my husband birthday;5.0;Every dishes like an art piece and taste very good. Sitting at the Chef table tonight is an unique experience, it overlooks the kitchen and we can interact with the chef while watching them preparing dishes and applying the finishing touches. Every staff is very nice and helpful! Every people in the kitchen are very focus on the food and you know that treat the food seriously and the kitchen is very clean. If you go, you should book the chef table!;mars-18;Pur' - Jean-François Rouquette
6;Perfect Service;4.0;My husband and I decided to celebrate our anniversary by trying Pur. The restaurant is beautiful, the service is the perfect blend of formal but never stiff or snooty. We decided to go “all in” and have the 8 course with wine pairing. Each course is beautifully presented and well balanced, the wines complemented as well. In retrospect, I think the six course option would have been plenty. For us a three hour meal was just too much. I can’t really find fault, but for me, I am not sure I would do it again. I completely understand why it is an expensive meal, but I personally just did not find it compelling enough to go again.;mars-18;Pur' - Jean-François Rouquette
6;You won't be disappointed;5.0;Crank up your foodie appetite and sit down for 6 or 8 delightful courses. Arrive hungry - there are several secret courses - a pre-desert, a second desert, a brioche, and cookies. The service is spot-on, and if you're lucky Jean-Francois will shake your hand on the way out.;mars-18;Pur' - Jean-François Rouquette
6;last night in Paris;5.0;"What a wonderful way to close out our Paris trip. An ""8 course"" dinner paired with some great wine. The service and the staff were just spectacular. It was such a great and delicious experience.....possibly one of the most romantic dinners we had.";févr-18;Pur' - Jean-François Rouquette
6;Simply Magnificent - Literally faultless;5.0;We had a very special anniversary meal here last month. The surroundings in the restaurant are beautiful, but were more than matched by the food, and the service we received. Both were utterly exceptional. We had the 6 course chef's menu with matching wines. The American sommellier was brilliant, and his choice of wines was great. The real star, as it should be, was the food. Every course, a faultless combination of flavour and textures, immaculately presented. Two glasses of d'Yquem finished a perfect evening!!;févr-18;Pur' - Jean-François Rouquette
6;Good but not overwhelming;4.0;We had dinner at Pur on a cold Paris night. The place is superbly decorated and has a unique, futuristic design. The photos on the web site are accurate. Tables are nicely spaced and the general feeling is very warm and inviting. Service was good and attentive. The Lobster was good and nicely presented. The pricey (145 euro) beef wagyu was very tiny - just 3 very small pieces and was just too soft. Took 30 seconds to eat them and It felt like eating a cube of fat although it was not fatty. Just very very soft. Somehow it did not feel like meat and it had a bit of a bland flavor. Maybe that is the idea about the wagyu being so high end but the experience is underwhelming at best. About 25 grams - fitting in two tea spoons for 145 euros is not worth it. Overall the food is good and presentation and service on par. They probably deserve their Michelin star but we were not overwhelmed.;févr-18;Pur' - Jean-François Rouquette
6;Amazing! Food and service - best restaurant I’ve been to in Paris;5.0;We had the 8 course tasting menu - absolutely sublime. The service was spot on, absolutely amazing. Fully recommend for dinner;févr-18;Pur' - Jean-François Rouquette
6;The BEST Meal of Our Lives;5.0;"OK, so this was special. We came to Paris for a week, to celebrate my beloved's 50th birthday. I did some research in advance, and decided that this will be the place.First thanks go to Mariana, who communicated with me in advance of the visit. Professional, prompt to reply, working with us on the 6-course menu (we don't eat meat), adjusting it to our food preferences and the special touches for the celebration.Then came the evening. Professional welcome, with elegance and grace. Once we got seated, we met James the sommelier. Unbelievably knowledgeable about wines and the profession at large. A delicious glass of champagne to start the evening, followed by an even more divine French red - to die for. On top of it, because we had fish, he recommended - and brought (on the house) - two glasses of white that fit the dish perfectly.The service from the whole team was superb. SUPERB! Luc was equally professional and friendly, and we engaged in a few conversations about how they run the place, and the world of Michelin stars.Then came dessert. Or, more specifically, first came the pre-dessert dish. It was followed by two separate dessert dishes, wrapping everything with a chocolate creation of one of the chefs who specializes in chocolate.We have both ""been around"" and traveled various parts of the world, separate and together - and experienced a variety of restaurants. We unanimously agreed that this was THE BEST restaurant experience of our lives! Sure, it was also the most expensive one - and I would pay it again for this experience, without thinking twice.Thank you Team Pur' for making this evening so unique for us!";févr-18;Pur' - Jean-François Rouquette
6;Simply out of this world!!;5.0;Why this restaurant is not in the top 5, i would not know, i would even say it should at least be in the top 10 restaurants in Paris (currently sitting at #12 when Im writing this review)!This was without a doubt my best meal I had and then to add to the experience was the outstanding service from all the staff!! I didn't get everyone's name, but Cyril was with us most of the night, so a special thank you to him. The food was breathtaking, the flavours that came out of the kitchen was mind blowing and I cannot wait to return, i will most defiantly be back soon! Thanks again to everyone at Pur!!;févr-18;Pur' - Jean-François Rouquette
6;Excellent;4.0;Excellent!We had a lovely time.The service is more than correct.However, a good music choice in the restaurant will gain them more sophistication.Thank you.;févr-18;Pur' - Jean-François Rouquette
6;superb.;5.0;8 course tasting menu. Yes, it’s a lot of food but can be battled through.Caviar starter immense. Lamb main like a meat yoghurt it was cooked so well. Fruit baba towards the end very refreshing.Accompanying wine flight perfect. Although the port at the end is a total sucker punch. Left very drunk.Service top notch as is custom in these places.Little gift bag containing cookies and brioche a nice touch.Ate at a few Michelin places in euro capitals but this one stands out.;févr-18;Pur' - Jean-François Rouquette
6;One of my all time favorite meals;5.0;Wonderfully coursed dinner with excellent wine pairings. Intimate setting with no rush at all. We felt we were guided through an amazing dinner and was the perfect way to end our Paris trip. Food was top notch and staff was welcoming and attentive. Unforgettable experience.;oct-17;Pur' - Jean-François Rouquette
6;A pleasant surprise in my own Hotel.;5.0;"While staying at Park Hyatt Vendôme in Paris for a business trip and after three consecutive nights of high end dining out ( including L'Atelier de Robuchon ) I've decided to try the ""House Restaurant"" for a relaxing dinner. Well.... has been a very pleasant surprise. Everything has been just perfect: from the sitting right in front of the ""state of the art"" kitchen to the mouth watering 6 courses Set Menu. But if I do have to select only one reason to be back at Pur well.... they serve the best pigeon I ever had in my life. And believe me if I'm telling that I had a lot!";févr-18;Pur' - Jean-François Rouquette
6;Very good;5.0;The atmosphere and layout of the restaurant is lovely, intimate and quite relaxed. Service was excellent from all staff. My first and main courses were great - first course was a delicious seafood veloute with an extremely generous garnish of white alba truffle, grilled wagyu beef main with tasty tapenades.;sept-17;Pur' - Jean-François Rouquette
6;Excellent;5.0;Had a wonderful dinner at Pur last night with the 6 course tasting menu for 100 Euros and the service like the rest of Park hyatt Vendome had been excellent.;oct-17;Pur' - Jean-François Rouquette
6;Unforgettable experience in a sumptuous restaurant;5.0;There are good restaurants with a rather pleasant setting. There are some excellent restaurants with a rather beautiful setting. And then, there's Pur ' - Jean-François Rouquette where each dish is an invitation to travel and happiness. Let's talk first about the very clean and classy setting of the restaurant. If you have to book, I invite you to request a table located in the middle of the central circle, as you can enjoy a beautiful view of the kitchen and a certain calm and silence. As for the dishes on offer, we chose to take the menu 'As Time Goes By...' (6 services). The menu was more than enough food for each of us. Asides from those 6 services, we were also welcomed with some fine amuse-bouche which set the tone for the night. Our favorite dish was either the Scallops from Brittany, where I recommend to try and have a bite where you enjoy all the items from that plate together (the grilled avocado, the confited pepper and lime). Then the medallions of French Venison were cooked to perfection. You should definitely eat those rosy. And the desserts were fantastic, the Jeu de Pommes (Apples) were refreshing and tasteful, while the two-part chocolat dessert was the perfect ending to a great dinner, worthy of such a distinguished institution. And the experience was also great all around. From the communications with the team before the dinner, to our departure from the restaurant, everything was above expectations. And if you arrive a bit early, do not miss a chance to hit the bar and have one of their homemade, refreshing and creative cocktails.I would definitely recommend for a date night, a family occasion or a business dinner, as it will be a memorable evening.;janv-18;Pur' - Jean-François Rouquette
6;Tre Paris taste;5.0;Spectacular dining. My wife replicate the same plate 2 times. The staff, the atmosphere were incredible. The kitchen like a war machine: very well organized and very effective;déc-17;Pur' - Jean-François Rouquette
6;Exceptional - The best food I have ever eaten;5.0;We at as a couple in June.I had hoped and expected it would be a very good experience, but it far exceeded my expectations. I have eaten in plenty of 2 and 3 Michelin starred restaurants including the Fat Duck, Le Manoir, The Dining Room at Whatley Manor but this was something extra special.The Mushroom starter and Lamb main were beautiful and delicious.The only slight negative was the sommelier trying to sell me £250 bottles of wine, when I was clearly not looking to spend that. Service overall was efficient. It was a lovely evening and worth the £450 for 2.Thank you;juin-17;Pur' - Jean-François Rouquette
6;Splurge!;5.0;If you want an exceptional evening, food, staff, and atmosphere- this is your place. From the moment we entered, they asked would we prefer english, we had a night of food prepared to the highest level and every attention to detail. We were celebrating a girlfriends 60th and it was worth every cent! The fireplaces in the lounge and the Christmas decorations only add to a perfect night. Don't miss it.;déc-17;Pur' - Jean-François Rouquette
6;Fantastic Birthday Dinner;5.0;"Decided to go to Pur' after reading great reviews of the restaurant and I have to say it did not disappoint. Went for the ""Temps Qui Passe"" six course tasting menu with wime pairing which was really on point, especially the Dublin Bay Prawns and the Venison. From beginning to end the service was truly amazing and I would find it hard to fault it in any way, from anticipating guest needs, the timing of each course and the friendliness of each waiter and waitress, of whom were well able to communicate to us both in english and french when we wanted to practise the language! I think the restauant really does set the standard for a one star michelin and should keep going the way it is and that everyone in the service and kitchen teams should be very proud of the consistently excellent work they're putting in!";nov-17;Pur' - Jean-François Rouquette
6;Fabulous!;5.0;Arrived at the hotel a bit early so went to the bar for a drink (10€ for water). When the restaurant opened at 8pm we went in and were given a table right by the open kitchen which to some may have been nice but it was slightly noisy. I asked to be moved which they did without hesitation. Had the tasting menu with wine pairing which was divine! Each course was fabulous. The restaurant itself was really nicely decorated and there was a really nice ambience.A few constructive criticisms- there was no wine pairing with the dessert courses which was disappointing. The service, although very attentive when serving and clearing the courses, was lacking somewhat when we asked for something in particular. We had to ask three times for more bread, twice for water and twice to see the menu. Granted very small issues but I would expect a restaurant of this quality to be able to cope with the basics easily.Great experience! Highly recommended, even at an eye watering 450€.;nov-17;Pur' - Jean-François Rouquette
6;amazing!;5.0;Excellent service, great wine selection, each dish just gets better and better, no pretense, good place to people watch as well. solid one star michelin restaurant. Fellow diners were wondering why certain Parisian restaurants do not have a star, and after having visited Pur', the reason(s) are evident. So good.;nov-17;Pur' - Jean-François Rouquette
6;Great food, impeccable service, wonderful wine;5.0;We decided to escape for the weekend in Paris. We arrived Friday night and got a 9.30pm table. Funny how 9.30pm feels more normal in Paris than London. Nice and very romantic atmosphere. Totally attentive service. They were monitoring when you run out of bread, water, anything and just replenish. The menu was out of this world. The initial wine we asked for was not available and they came back with another one that probably even better than the one we originally chose. I will email the restaurant to get the details, we were too absorbed in the food and with each other to even remember. I can't recommend it enough. At EUR 200 per head all in (menu is EUR 145 per head anyway) it is not cheap but there are times that you deserve much finer food than what you usually get in your daily life.;oct-17;Pur' - Jean-François Rouquette
6;Deserves another star!;5.0;We had an absolutely superb meal in this spacious yet cosy restaurant where the staff are professional, warm and helpful. We ordered à la carte and had 3 courses each. the restaurant also offers an appetiser, an amuse bouche and a pre-dessert, so you end up with six courses. None of these are too large so you leave feeling satisfied not bloated. There is a good wine list of regional varieties by the glass, and bread (3 types) is topped up as needed.All the courses were delicious, the flavours nicely balanced and the textures memorable. the produce is obviously highest quality and the dishes looked enticing on the plate. Having recently tried a few 1 star restaurants around France on this trip, this is definitely a step up. A fabulous experience!;oct-17;Pur' - Jean-François Rouquette
6;An exquisite degstation at the hands of one of the world great chefs;5.0;My start to my dinner at this stunning French fine dining Restaurant located in the Park Hyatt Vendome was a drink in the open air bar with a opera singer singing live about 5 metres from my table. Her voice was as beautiful as the 9 courses of food I enjoyed an hour later in one of the world's great restaurants, Pur.The amuse bouche sums up the entire meal - it was served on 3 different plates, and included tiny bursts of flavour and texture which set a startling tone to the evening. Only Michelin star chefs with decades of experience can produce such delicate and intimate combinations of taste.The menu is wide and varied, but with such an extra ordinary chef, indulging in the designation and letting him take control as a must. We enjoyed langoustine carpaccio, Challan's duck with eggplant, harissa of piquillos and raspberries, The Cocoa dessert, all combined with astonishingly beautiful flavours.;oct-17;Pur' - Jean-François Rouquette
6;Great evening;5.0;We were staying at the Park Hyatt for our wedding anniversary and had booked a table for a special dinner. We went for the Trip Diary menu with matched wines. Not cheap at €275 per person but definitely a special experience.We had a drink in the bar first as the restaurant wasn't ready for us at 8PM. We got seated just before 8:30. I guess they were trying to avoid everyone sitting down for dinner at the same time.The service was very professional albeit a little reserved but I guess that is what they are aiming for. The food generally was excellent and the wine pairings were in the main great.Highlights for us were the fish course with razor clams and also the lobster. The meal was completed with a pastry served with cream flavoured with white pepper - delicious but very filling. The snail starter was OK but not something I would probably try again.The only downside to our meal was the table of three women who spent the whole evening either taking selfies, playing music on their phones or talking loudly on their phones. Shame people like this are allowed!;sept-17;Pur' - Jean-François Rouquette
6;Incredible meal and memorable evening!;5.0;My husband and I had dinner here while staying at the hotel, and had an absolutely wonderful experience. Be prepared to spend a few hours enjoying a perfectly paced and intimate coursed meal here. From the dining room to the flatware to the plating to the food, you absolutely feel that you are getting a Michelin meal at Pur. The service was absolutely perfect--particularly by European standards-and the gastronomy was exceptional. This was one of the few fine dining experiences where I didn't feel that pretentiousness clouded or eclipsed the actual quality of the meal. The dishes were complex, interesting, and unique. Highlights were the duck and the langoustine off the tasting menu. The wine list is also predictably excellent. JFR actually came out and spoke with each of the tables toward the end of the evening--unfortunately I was hardly able to get more than a few words out in my terrible French, but it's clear that he's deeply invested in guests' experiences at the restaurant. One thing to note is that this is a very expensive meal, so I would take that into consideration before bringing small children or a large family. Overall, an incredible experience that we'll remember.;sept-17;Pur' - Jean-François Rouquette
6;It could be excelent if it wasn't so pretentious!;4.0;"Overall the food and the quality of the ingredients is very good, well prepared and smart presentation.But food is also about taste which, in my view for a Michelin star restaurant, it to surprise us with flavors or textures that we would not expect. The dishes, namely the starter, did not achieve this goal.Overall, liked the experience but not loved it!It's a restaurant to visit in Paris but I would not give him a ""must visit when in Paris"", which was my expectation...In my humble opinion, probably a little less pretentious approach to the food, putting more flavor, would make the experience fabulous...The place is very beautiful and elegant...Dress smart for the occasion.";sept-17;Pur' - Jean-François Rouquette
6;Memorable evening;5.0;Michelin star experience here. Had the taster menu which was supposed to be 6 courses I think but in reality ended up being about 10 courses! Spent several hours really enjoying everything. Would definitely recommend. Worth the price.;avr-17;Pur' - Jean-François Rouquette
6;Exceptional Experience;5.0;We stumbled upon this restaurant only because it was the only Michelin restaurant we could find that was open on a Sunday evening in the summer. What we found was one of the best restaurants of our 10 day eating tour of France.It is rare to find a chef who can maintain consistency of quality and innovation across a tasting menu, but Pur' pulled it off. We were delighted by every course -- and felt there was nothing derivative or tired but the food. Moreover, the wine pairing was exceptional -- we were impressed by the pairings. I will definitely return to Pur' in the next few years. I look forward to seeing the chef's evolution. For anyone serious about food, this place is worth a visit.;juil-17;Pur' - Jean-François Rouquette
6;A bit overprice but nice foods and service;3.0;I made my reservation online and indicated it was a celebration. They arranged a table right beside the kitchen, we were able to interact and watch the chef while they prepare the food. NOTE: it is a table with high chairs – so for those who doesn’t enjoy fine dining with high chair, you might want to emphasis that when you make your reservation. In general, it was a great experience with good food but I would agree with most of other comments, it is a bit overpriced but due to the location and it is inside a hotel – I think it is still acceptable. Another feeling I have got, which was mentioned in other review, a bit rush as a fine dining experience. It was not a rush from the people, I think that feeling came from …. No time in between each course which I found it fairly uncommon in French / fine dining restaurant.My advice is: if you are going for the food and careless of the location – then I might choose another restaurant.;juil-17;Pur' - Jean-François Rouquette
6;Wonderful experience;5.0;We managed to book a table for dinner on the day. It was one of the best meals I had. Service was flawless, environment was romantic, and the food was spectacular!You can see and taste all the details of each dishes and of course the presentation was beautiful! Another Michelin star restaurant chef was dining by himself next to us and he seemed to be really impressed as well. You will not regret visiting here!;août-17;Pur' - Jean-François Rouquette
6;A fantastic dining experience- ambience, staff, and food all top-notch;5.0;This was a wonderfully relaxing and inviting dining experience after a long day of touring. The reputation of this restaurant led to our choosing to eat here and we were not disappointed in the least- it fully lived up to its high status. Located in a posh hotel, the atmosphere is modern and sophisticated and the cushioned seating was very comfortable.The food is outstanding- flavorful, beautifully presented, and ample. It is gratifying to know that just because you are in a fancy restaurant does not mean portions will be meager- you will not go hungry here. The staff were friendly and timed everything perfectly- again the mark of an excellent dining experience where your needs are met but you are not smothered or disturbed. It was a pleasure to relax and take time to enjoy the meal and feel neither delayed nor hurried. If you like tomatoes, you will love their three variety tomato entree, but, I can't see going wrong with anything on the menu. This was a real treat and it is worth every penny.;juin-17;Pur' - Jean-François Rouquette
6;Fantastic experience;5.0;Visited the restaurant after my graduation ceremony in Paris and this was the perfect way to finish off an amazing day. Not only are the staff incredibly friendly, but they are also so attentive, yet do not over crowd you! The food was exceptional (we have the 6 course taster menu) and I would 100% recommend to anyone! Having dinned also at le Jules Verne up the Eiffel Tower, I would say this restaurant has an equal wow factor, and the ambiance is superb. Hopefully be back again soon! \;juil-17;Pur' - Jean-François Rouquette
6;Michelin was generous;3.0;This was the second time that I had dined at Pur. The first time, in 2013 was a great experience, but the second, in 2017 was the opposite. The cuisine was still good, but not worthy, in my opinion, of a Michelin star. For 180 Euros per person, my family and I expected much more. The service was excellent on both visits, but it didn't make up for the lackluster cuisine.;avr-17;Pur' - Jean-François Rouquette
6;Excellent dining experience;5.0;This restaurant is truly special. Well appointed and minimalist dining room with plenty of room between tables, leaving the entire ambiance quiet and free of distractions. A partially open kitchen lets you see those busy at preparing your dishes, but with none of the ambient noise. Tasting menu was really well designed, and the centerpiece of each dish was the highlight, complemented nicely by the various components. The plates were were presented and demonstrated creativity and interesting flavor combinations. Everything was perfectly cooked, and the wines accompanying each dish were sensitively chose and explained. Service is extremely attentive and friendly, but not overly intrusive. They are always close by, but provide space to enjoy each dish. Of course it is quite expensive, but you leave satisfied and feeling like you have had a really nice experience. Without doubt one of the top restaurants in Paris.;juil-17;Pur' - Jean-François Rouquette
6;The restaurant is good but clearly overrated;3.0;I can't deny that I had a good dinner, but I must say, it wasn't the best or one of the best in Paris.The service was polite but not very friendly, the quality of the dishes was good but not the best. Search elsewhere for a better experience;juil-17;Pur' - Jean-François Rouquette
6;Wonderful anniversary dinner;5.0;"We, family of 4, had a great 25th anniversary dinner on June 27th. We had a ""Menu in 8 courses"" and were all absolutely pleased with everything. The wait staffs were pleasant and helpful, and the dishes were creative and superb. The kitchen, the staff, the menu, the wine list, the bakery are all the finest. I will recommend to everyone and will definitely come back again in the near future. Thank you for wonderful dinner.";juin-17;Pur' - Jean-François Rouquette
6;AMAZING TIME - AMAZING FOOD - AMAZING CIGARS!;5.0;So it was the Saturday and my reservation was cancelled at another reputable fine dining establishment...NO FEAR!My hotelier found me a spot in this restaurant he used to work in and boy was it great!!!As you'd expect the service was incredible and the flavours amazing.After your fine dining experience, why not settle down in the court yard and enjoy one of their finest cigars.Incredible experience.;juin-17;Pur' - Jean-François Rouquette
6;Excellent degustation dinner with wine pairing;5.0;I visit Paris annually in summer and make sure to always enjoy one dinner at Jean-Francois Rouquette's restaurant pur.Soon after my arrival I contacted the concierge to make a booking for me. At that point in time unfortunately no table was available anymore and I was offered to join the waitlist or make a booking at another restaurant.Luckily, I joined the waitlist which within 24 hours confirmed the booking.My friends and I ended up dining at the chef's table, which can be separated from the restaurant by curtains and provides a more romantic dining experience. We chose Chef Rouquette's 8 course diary tasting menu and wine pairing which was an excellent choice.;juin-17;Pur' - Jean-François Rouquette
6;Romantic Dinner;4.0;My boyfriend and I had one of the most memorable dinners at Pur in October 2016 during our romantic trip to Paris. We were greeted and corteously accompanied to the table I had reserved one week before. I have to admit: I was impressed by the internal decor, romantic lighting and style of the restaurant. The waitress was kind enough to allow us to add one dish to the menu we selected.The reason I am giving 4 stars to our experience is due to the somelier. I thought she was not very knowledgeable and her advices were vague. I am a big wine lover and I certainly expected better suggestions... also the service was not perfect and our table often lacked attention as I was obligated to pour my own wine several times. I believe a place like Pur with delicious food and high prices deserves as exceptional and impeccable service. I recommend the restaurant nonethelese :);oct-16;Pur' - Jean-François Rouquette
6;Fantastic tasting menu;5.0;My friend and I read the reviews before choosing this restaurant and we were very pleased to find out the positive reviews didn't fail to disappoint. The tasting menu portions were much bigger then I expected. We were very full by the end of this dinner...and we skipped the bread. We did the wine pairing along with the tasting menu and we were very happy with the knowledge the Sommelier offered.I would recommend this restaurant to anyone who loves fine dinning and is visiting Paris.;juin-17;Pur' - Jean-François Rouquette
6;Wonderful Dinner;5.0;Paris is not lacking for great restaurants and since this was a vacation, there's always the fear that we might make the wrong choice. With choosing Pur' we definitely made the right choice. The restaurant itself is beautiful, but beyond that the service was very warm, welcoming and knowledgeable and the food itself was excellent. The presentations for the plates were really pretty and only outdone by how good the dished tasted.;mai-17;Pur' - Jean-François Rouquette
6;Outstanding Dinner;5.0;My wife and I enjoyed an outstanding dinner at Pur. Our appetizers were perfectly prepared as was our main course. The many delicious small dishes also served during our meal added a special touch to our dining experience. The sommelier helped us choose a great burgundy that went perfectly with our meal. We especially appreciated the wonderful and attentive service provided by the restaurant staff.;avr-17;Pur' - Jean-François Rouquette
6;Outstanding food and service;5.0;"I had one of the best meals ever in Pur. I ordered the multi-course ""Carnet de voyage"" tasting menu with matching wines. It was outstanding! All dishes were delicious, beautifully presented and perfectly matched with excellent wines. The service was exceptional. Nina and Camille were very professional, kind and nice. I highly recommend this restaurant for a fine dinner in Paris.";mai-17;Pur' - Jean-François Rouquette
6;Great parisian address, I highly recommand;5.0;Dinner with some friends which were visiting. They enjoyed it as much as we did!I had the fois gras and the lamb. Both were excellent. The place is elegant and cosy. Its a great Parisian address.;mai-17;Pur' - Jean-François Rouquette
6;A Special Occasion;5.0;Our selection of 'Pur' for our dinner on Easter Saturday, was solely based on the fact that it was the highest restaurant in the Trip Advisor listing that still had capacity to fit us in, but how glad we were that chance took us there. From start to finish the meal was a delight. We didn't select the tasting menu because neither of us are big eaters, and it seems a shame to leave food of this calibre. Instead we chose the recommendations of the day: asparagus three ways, foie gras chaud, and blue lobster. ( I gather from Wikipedia that these are extremely rare,one in two million, to my unsophisticated palate it didn't taste any different !)The asparagus was a delight, with a smooth velouté, a tangy carpaccio, and a tempura battered spear. The foie was meltingly beautiful, perfectly cooked and still warm, my only criticism is that the richness of foie really needs to be counterbalanced with something sharp, like rhubarb.And the lobster was just perfect,... and blue !! All the waiting staff were pleasant, efficient and unobtrusive, while the kitchen was a hive of activity. For a meal this exceptional you don't even look at the bill, which is probably just as well !;avr-17;Pur' - Jean-François Rouquette
6;Amazing restaurant;5.0;We opted for the 6 course tasting menu, it was amazing, ended up with 9 dishes in total. Each dish was cooked and presented to perfection. The service we received from start to finish was outstanding. It was an expensive evening but it was definitely worth every single penny, the restaurant exceeded all expectations. Would definitely recommend for a special evening.;avr-17;Pur' - Jean-François Rouquette
6;Why only 1* Michelin?;5.0;It's a travesty that Pur' has only one Michelin star. Having dined in many one, two and three star restaurants in France, Belgium, Germany and the UK the dinner we had was right up there with the best of them. We took the six course tasting menu on the advice of the maître D' who said that the eight course menu was a lot of food. It was good advice because six courses was perfect for us. Often when having a tasting menu there are one or two courses that are less enjoyable but here every one is something that I would order again.Service was very good - friendly and not over formal.The only very slight negative is that a glass of champagne was the thick end of 30 euro (though it was a better than normal champagne) and there are very few (if any) bottles of wine at less than 70 euro, and not a lot below 100. In any case we will return the next time we are in Paris.;avr-17;Pur' - Jean-François Rouquette
6;Excellent food and formal service;4.0;We opted for the 8 course Trip Diary menu, which also included amuse bouche and a small starter. To accompany the food we also had the wine pairings. The food and wine was fantastic with well-balanced tastes all the way through. Wine servings a bit on the small side, but a refilling of the Mersault helped us getting through :)First 3-4 dishes were served too fast, but we asked the waiters to slow down, and the remaining service was impeccable.In general, I like less formal restaurants, but also appreciate that this is 1 star Michelin in Paris trying to obtain the 2nd one, so formality is expected.;avr-17;Pur' - Jean-François Rouquette
6;Wonderful Parisian experience!;5.0;Pur exceeded all our expectations. Impeccable service, lovely ambiance. We ordered the 8-course tasting menu with wine pairings, had champagne to start and just had an all-in-all wonderful time. Each dish was more delicious than the next. As we were celebrating my birthday, they brought me a candle with dessert and we truly could not have asked for more.;mars-17;Pur' - Jean-François Rouquette
6;Great food and deserts;5.0;"Went to PUR with wife and friends for lunch. The food was great, the atmosphere excellent and service ""impeccable""! Deserts were so good, we had 2 rounds of them. Great place to chill and enjoy your meal.";mars-17;Pur' - Jean-François Rouquette
6;Christmas Dinner Disaster;1.0;Worst experience I had in Paris. I booked Christmas Evening reservations online about 2 months prior. I flew in on Christmas Day from the US and was very excited about the upcoming dinner which was a surprise for my wife. Upon arrival, I was told that there were no reservations for myself and my wife, despite me showing them the confirmation email and number I had received. They responded that the online reservation system must have made an error. I was told there was no way they could seat me or otherwise help. Then, the staff basically threw us out so that they could attend to others who were also arriving for an 8p meal.This was Christmas Night, in Paris. There were no other restaurants that could accommodate us on such late notice. We ended up not eating dinner at all.We tried many other quality restaurants in Paris while there, including others with Michelin stars. There is a level of professionalism and service that is to be expected at such places, and Pur lacked those qualities entirely.;déc-16;Pur' - Jean-François Rouquette
6;Amazing;5.0;To celebrate a career change I decided on going to PUR last Friday. I absolutely made the right choice. The staff were all so attentive and professional. Everyone was just so friendly. Now the food. I was in bliss. Each dish had its own unique flavour. After each dish I was left craving for more, and the chef more than satisfied it. The portions , the presentation, the taste. And oh, the complementary dishes in the middle of each course was just a delight. I wld definitely recommend the blue lobster and the chocolate tree for dessert. Thanks !!!;févr-17;Pur' - Jean-François Rouquette
6;Why can't I give Pur' 6 stars?!;5.0;It's the morning after the night before and I'm still thinking about the amazing experience at Pur'! I'm not sure I can put down in word how excellent our visit was, but I would honestly say this was the highlight of a very touristy weekend in Paris.From start to finish this was amazing - we both went for the 6 course taster menu which was easily 11/12 courses and I've not been so full in a restaurant of this quality before! I will say this is a comfortable level of fine dining - the menu and ingredients are not massively intricate yet the results are mind blowing.The level of service was perfect. My wife for example could not entertain the idea of pigeon (which was beautiful!) which was substituted for beef (also spot on). At 145€ the food worked out with the various amuse-bouche etc at less than £10 per course. Wine/champagne did add a bit to the overall bill as expected in a hotel restaurant but to be honest I felt the evening was worth every penny.The highlight would have to be the monkfish which was cooked to perfection. The chocolate experience near the end is a must for cocoa lovers! My only issue would be that with a glance at the bill at the end of the night I assumed 20% service had been added and it was only afterwards that I realised two levels of tax (for food and alcohol) had been applied, so actually left without tipping! If anyone at the restaurant reads this, apologies for not concentrating enough in French class!! I hope there is a next time when I can double tip!;janv-17;Pur' - Jean-François Rouquette
6;Christmas Eve;5.0;We had reservations for this restaurant for Christmas Eve 2016. The meal was a fixe prix which was excellent. We chose to have the meal with wine pairings. The whole experience was exceptional and exceeded our expectations. The service was also impeccable.;déc-16;Pur' - Jean-François Rouquette
6;Excellent *****;5.0;We dined at PUR for my fiancee's birthday. We had the 6 course tasting menu. Absolutely perfect from start to finish. Excellent service. There was hushed background music which accompanied the food and wine very well. *****;janv-17;Pur' - Jean-François Rouquette
6;Good food, but average service;3.0;We went here because of the good critics and we had a good diner but... For the price we paid per person including wine-pairing, we had aspected more attention from the staff. Like cleaning the table or changing the cutlery was not as we should aspect in a restaurant of this quality. The sommelier was losing interest as the evening progressed. To bad, because the food was very good.;déc-16;Pur' - Jean-François Rouquette
6;Food and service the best;5.0;The service at this restaurant was impeccable and the food was excellent. Highly recommend this restaurant for anyone in Paris looking for a great time.;déc-16;Pur' - Jean-François Rouquette
6;Triple AAA restaurant;5.0;The best restaurant I had to try in Paris and I went to a bunch of them! All top 100 rated on TripAdvisor but this one is truly superb! The deserts were excellent and every from the beginning till the end amazingly dished out and the staff is handling you with great care.;déc-16;Pur' - Jean-François Rouquette
6;Exquisite food, impeccable service and very classy;5.0;We enjoyed the atmosphere, it was nice and quite. Exquisite food, impeccable service and very classy.The meal and the wine's selection was outstanding and the service and explanations on all courses were most enlightening. It was one of our highlights on our mini vacation to Paris.;sept-16;Pur' - Jean-François Rouquette
6;Elegant, but not that great;3.0;Given all the positive reviews, we chose this restaurant to celebrate a 50th birthday. The decor and ambiance are nice and service is what you would expect at Michelin star restaurant : attentive and polite. We chose the six course menu with a wine pairing. Food was good but not really exceptional. However, there were two things in particular that we both found unsatisfactory : when you choose a wine pairing for an additional 140 euros it is a bit annoying when wines are quite average and they just pour you a little drop. That's a rip off. In other words - avoid the wine pairing. Another thing is that the menu is not very well balanced. At the end there is a whole row of desserts/sweets. We'd rather have a little bit more of the main course. You finish a meal with something sweet - not loads of it. In total I think we spent 470 euros for two. Was it worth it? We don't think so.;nov-16;Pur' - Jean-François Rouquette
6;Perfect food, perfect service;5.0;Party of four, we dined at the Pur' for my sisters birthday! It was a very good choice! One of the best meals I ever had! The coordination between the open kitchen, servers and sommelier is like in a Broadway musical! And you're part of it! Perfect for an anniversary diner! High quality food (deserves 2 stars) in a perfect setting! Feels very luxurious but in the same time very cosy! Staff knows when to be there for you and when to stay away! Amazing!;oct-16;Pur' - Jean-François Rouquette
6;Flavorful Entrees! Need Better Desserts (3.5 Stars).;4.0;"During my stay in Paris, I wanted to have at least one fine dining experience. I chose Pur' since it was a Michelin starred restaurant and they were open on a Sunday. Many French restaurants are closed on Sundays, so I was happy to find a one that was open. You should make a reservation. If I remember correctly, I think I made mine about a month in advance. The restaurant is located in the Hyatt hotel.The ambiance is very nice. Typical of many hotel restaurants. However, it had a more loungey, but classy, feel which I found relaxing and nice. I liked the lounge like seating as opposed to rows of tables and chairs.Come dressed nice - you do not have to be too formal - no gowns. But dress as you would when you go to a special occasion at church or formal work function.I had the 6 course pre-fixe with wine pairings which included:- Monkfish, Fennel, and Sweet Potato dish- Duck Foie Gras with Green Beans, and Quinoa in a Yogurt/Horseradish Sauce- Beef with Potatoes- A few dessert dishesThe staff was very accommodating to my friends peanut allergy, so I am unsure if the selections are in line with what they actual offer on their menu. I let them know during the reservation period and when we got there, they were very attentive to ensure that they met our dietary needs. In general, the service was superb. I feel confident in saying that it was the best service I had in Paris. Very professional and polite staff.The wine pairings were superb. Everything paired well nicely. I did not like the port with dessert. However, that is not held against the restaurant as port is considered a dessert drink. I personally just don't care for port. Especially not with dessert. Not sure where that rule was established. lol.I was a huge fan of all the entrees. It is very difficult for me to pick a favorite. I guess I would have to say the Monkfish. However, the Duck Foie Gras and Beef were cooked perfectly. I loved the layers of flavors. They were hearty without being heavy. They were nicely presented as well. The entrees itself would give this restaurant a 5 stars.I gave 3.5 tar because of the desserts. I did not care much for the desserts. In fact, I do not think I really remember any of them. They consisted a big portion of the meal (8 in total I think). I do think I had a dessert with brie - and I remember eating it. This says a lot because no one can get me to eat brie. I usually do not have the pallet for it (it's possible it wasn't brie). But generally, the desserts were not memorable.As an American, and this being my first fine dining experience of this caliber, it was difficult for me to get used to the tiny food. I am big into nutrition, and technically, the food is perfect portion sizes. However, it didn't prevent me from wanting a juicy turkey burger afterwards. I did not leave full.I stopped at the restaurant bar after dinner. They had some very unique cocktails. I ordered the ""Puki Puki"" simply because I liked the name. It was a very beautiful and tastey cocktail. Very tastey cocktail - more memorable than the dinner wine. I vote that all restaurants should offer cocktail pairings with pre-fixe dinner. That would be nice!The 6-course pre-fixe will run you about 235 Euro - not bad considering some other fine dining resteraunts were almost double.";sept-16;Pur' - Jean-François Rouquette
6;I guess the food is good but...;2.0;Most of the food I tasted was good, but God, insanely overpriced! The service was weird and rushed as well. If you want to spend 400 bucks on one main course, shared starter and wine, go ahead, but not worth it!;nov-16;Pur' - Jean-François Rouquette
6;Returned to Paris;5.0;After a dinner in Giverny at a 1 Michelin starred restaurant we dined at Pur' also a 1 starred restaurant. What a difference. The service was more polished and the servers knowledgeable about the offerings. Since it is located in the Hyatt we were staying we confirmed our reservation at check-in. We had the tasting menu and matched wines. The courses were without the complete listing of ingredients. mushrooms , duckling with eggplant, goat cheese, figs with white cheese sorbet, and a to die for desert. The wines matched with each dish were perfect. The plating were artistic without being over the top. Dinner lasted over 2.5 hours and it was a great experience.;sept-16;Pur' - Jean-François Rouquette
6;Excellence;5.0;My husband and I visited the restaurant for dinner and were super impressed by both the impeccable service and the excellent food. Every detail is taken care of from the moment you arrive and are offered a glass of champagne to the moment you leave and they gift you a small bag of cookies to take with you. The food is delicious and the chef came out to greet all the tables at the end of service which was a great touch. We loved it and no wonder it has a michelin star.;oct-16;Pur' - Jean-François Rouquette

6;Realized what quality and art tasted like;5.0;My husband and I are our wedding celebration dinner here and felt is was a great choice for the memories. We loved the ambience of the restaurant and the open kitchen concept. We chose the smaller tasting trip menu and were surprised at the amount of food we recieved. Every course was divine with the subtle layed flavors in them. The desserts were astounding. Would return to try other menu selection should we return to Paris. Highly recommended for a special evening or just to have really quality food.;oct-16;Pur' - Jean-François Rouquette
6;Paris fine dinner;5.0;In September my wife and I dinned at the Pur'.We chose the 6-course menu.Every dish was special,of exquisite quality,imagination and presentation.Calm, relaxing ambience with low lighting and beautiful decoration.The numerous and polite staff attended us with care and promptness.However the way they served us (the continuous flow of dishes)gave us a negative feeling of hastiness and distance between the staff and us.Overall our dinner at the Pur' was worth it and I suggest visiting it.;sept-16;Pur' - Jean-François Rouquette
6;Really great food and atmosphere;5.0;Whilst having a real air of pretentiousness, it is a really good restaurant. The tables have lots of space between and nothing is too much trouble for the attentive and friendly servers. The sommelier is really knowledgeable and try's to recommend interesting wine and does not try and recommend the most expensive. She is a real asset. It's is a fantastic experience and not as madly expensive as some top end Parisian restaurants. Highly recommended.;sept-16;Pur' - Jean-François Rouquette
6;Bliss;5.0;I would just like to say what a fabulous evening we had here to celebrate my husbands 50th. Even before we arrived the staff were fabulous, making every effort to make sure his meal was memorable. We opted for the 8 course tasting menu, which is really about 12 once all the amuse bouches are counted in. Each course was stunning but the wild mushroom and bramble starter stands out for its simplicity of ingredients but amazing flavour. Apparently it was the chefs mothers recipe originally and the brambles had been foraged in the south of France by one of the kitchen team while on a recent holiday. Such commentary by the service team just added to our glorious experience. The serving staff were very helpful, attentive and at the same time unobtrusive. This was perfect as it never once felt like we were in a stuffy, overly regimented Michelin starred restaurant. I would highly recommend this restaurant and hopefully will return if ever in Paris again. We went all in and had the champagne to start the evening in style and the wine flight to compliment the food. The wine choices were perfect with the food. The bill was expensive but partly down to a v weak Pound, saying that we expected to pay what we did and never felt like we had been ripped off Indeed I would say for the quality of service and food we had it could easily have been more and we wold still have been content. Well done to the entire team x;sept-16;Pur' - Jean-François Rouquette
6;Fine Hotel Dining Experience;5.0;"My wife and I ate at Pur during our stay at the Park Hyatt Vendome. The service, atmosphere and food were easily worthy of its Michelin star. Our waiter and sommelier were very accommodating, and this ended up making our night. By splitting appetizers, entrees and wine, they created a virtual four course ""customized"" tasting menu with wine pairings for both of us. Overall, there's a lot of competition in the area. But, if you're staying at the hotel (already a high end experience), this is a worthwhile complement.";août-16;Pur' - Jean-François Rouquette
6;Really wonderful;5.0;We ate here on a recent trip to Paris and were most pleased. After a perfectly horrible meal at Jules Verne, we felt like we deserved this terrific treat. It is not inexpensive, but almost half of what we paid at the tourist ripoff Jules Verne. Staff was welcoming and warm, even to English speakers. We began with an excellent glass of Champagne from their cart of several choices. The foie gras was meltingly delicious and served with a quinoa crumb, nice change from the traditional accompaniment. The lobster was tender and fresh, and all was served with care and warmth. We will go again.;sept-16;Pur' - Jean-François Rouquette
6;Gourmet's Delight!;5.0;This restaurant is situated in Park Hyatt Vendome in Paris. Absolutely incredible food with excellent service and a true delight for anyone who appreciates gourmet food at its best! Every course was a picture on a plate and the flavours were amazing.I will definitely be back! Truly worth every penny!;sept-16;Pur' - Jean-François Rouquette
6;Better than the 3 Michelin Restaurants - Chef's Table review.;5.0;We visited two 3 Michelin star restaurants in Paris during our vacation and enjoyed the Chef's Table at Pur much more! Both food and experience wise. The first thing we noticed was how professional the staff at Pur was. As we got to the host we told her we have the Chef's Table and from that moment forward we were treated like royalty. There were about 5 waiters constantly at our disposal and we were escorted to our semi private section where we were seated at a large table connected to the kitchen, with curtains around us so we could still see some of the dining room yet still felt very private. We had an open space from the table directly to the kitchen and the rest was glass, the way the chef's in the kitchen orchestrated the dinner was beautiful. They were so organized, so professional, so detail oriented and so quiet it was like a perfectly in sync dance. It was so impressive to watch them do what they do best and to get to then enjoy their works of art was the best part. Every dish was amazing and my husband and I were both blown away. We didn't want the night to end but I will say we left VERY full and happy.;juil-16;Pur' - Jean-François Rouquette
6;Desert heavy, a few misses;4.0;Its hard to review this place. First - very attentive staff, if a little stiff - but, as its a top end place, no problems with that.The food went from stunning to complete misses, not bad, but unbalanced...Not my favorite M.S. place.;juil-16;Pur' - Jean-François Rouquette
6;Great restaurant in the heart of Paris.;5.0;We had a romantic 8 course dinner with beautiful wines.Staff was very nice and service minded, we were treated like royals.All dishes was was amazing, and we actually ended up with around 11 courses.Everything was beautiful put together with great precision and texture.I really recommend going all in and order the largest 8 course dinner.;sept-16;Pur' - Jean-François Rouquette
6;of course 1 star Michelin, excellent food, and service, the chef comes to salute clients;5.0;of course 1 star Michelin, excellent food, my preference goes to anything salty since I would rather bake and eat that fancy desserts. Beyond expectations is service, attentive, courteous, explaining ingredients and conception. The chef comes to salute his clients, and gave me tips on preparing an amuse gueule. Genial!;sept-16;Pur' - Jean-François Rouquette
6;The highlight of our Paris trip;5.0;We celebrated our 15th wedding anniversary in Paris and decided to go to Pur as the highlight of the stay.Reservation was done online and quickly confirmed, overall the service high class and very friendly.The style of the restaurant which is located at the Hyatt hotel close Place Vendome is modern and very stylish.We were guided to our table and started with Champagne as aperitif while studying the menu which did not show prices in the Lady’s version – very nice.The selection in the menu was just great, we decided to go for the 6 courses with wine.Starting with the amuse gueule over the single course to the dessert was like a surprising journey of tastes exploding in our mouth, everything of highest quality and very delicious.The wines served to the courses were great and perfectly fitted to support the test of the meals.We eat quite often in Michelin star restaurants during our trips but never had such a great experience like in Pur – we will definitely go there next time we are in Paris.;sept-15;Pur' - Jean-François Rouquette
6;Awesome!;5.0;Dining at Pur' is worth every last euro (and that's quite a few euros!). We had the six-course menu, which turned out to be more around ten. Each and every dish cooked to perfection. Service was attentive, and politely friendly. The wine selection was perfect, but unnecessarily small (5-10 cl each, maybe?) Skip the champagne aperitif unless you're really keen on it.;août-16;Pur' - Jean-François Rouquette
6;Totally underwhelmed;3.0;"Attended for dinner on Thursday 25/8. I think they lost me on arrival at the restaurant when we were told we could not enter because we were 3 minutes early, the restaurant would not open until 8pm and as we were literally minutes early, were asked to wait in the hotel lobby. Really?? How utterly pretentious. Is this really how a Michelin starred restaurant would treat their patrons, obviously yes. I was gobsmacked. Like most other reviewers who had not previously dined Michelin star, I was eagerly awaiting this evening with much anticipation. On finally being allowed in after the expiration of those 3 minutes, I must say I was extremely surprised at how low the lighting was, thinking instantly upon being seated ""you eat with your eyes"" so how on earth was I going to do this when it was that dark I could not even see what colour my food was. The service could be said to be faultless, but it could also be said it was so over the top it made you laugh at the antics, and I have to agree totally with another reviewer who likened it to a fully choreographed ballet. I conjured up thoughts of ants rushing hither and tither across a very large ants nest. Three wait staff to serve two diners at a table. Clearly what sets a Michelin star dining experience apart from all of those ordinary dinners out was totally lost on me. Underwhelmed by the whole experience, which to be honest I felt very sad about because I so wanted to enjoy my night. I think the absolute icing on the cake, after the wait in the lobby and the low light level was the fact that the 6 course tasting menu that was served was NOT what was advertised on the restaurant's website. This was what was used by us to make the decison to book the table. When this was mentioned, someone of importance was so mooned and came to our table to explain to us that the menu had been changed ""yesterday"" and there was a lag in the website update. Fine dining at its best? Debatable. Amends were made by the provision of a dish we said was listed on the website but had not been offered, the crab and calamari cannelloni.I am sure the chefs worked extremely hard preparing our food though in the main my impression was most of the dishes were overpowered by one or more ingredient in the dish or a sauce, to the point where I found some dishes were inedible because of it. I am not a fussy eater by any means, but can honestly say the dinner as a whole was a total waste of money. At least this dinner provided me with a Michelin star dining experience which many many people could not lay claim to having done. Suffice to say I won't be rushing to repeat this experience. I am certain all of the wait staff knew how we felt because no comment was made whatsoever on our departure. No ""thank you"", ""hope you enjoyed your dinner"" NO nothing. We paid our bill and got up and left, not one single person even bothered to say goodbye as we left.Value for money? NoFood? NoService? Too over the top for my likingSadly, I will not be repeating my Pur' experience.";août-16;Pur' - Jean-François Rouquette
6;A Treat for the Tastebuds;5.0;We were in Paris for our anniversary. no better time to try our first Michelin star restaurant and we were not disappointed. The service was attentive and proper but not stuffy. We had the eight course tasting menu. The lobster and turbot were my favourite. It was an evening of adventure for our taste buds, and a very full meal we could not quite finish however thoroughly enjoyed.;juil-16;Pur' - Jean-François Rouquette
6;OK but not amazing;4.0;Was there with partner and friendsService OKWine list on the pricey side. cocktails ridiculously expensiveA few small surprising things for a * restaurant, especially at this price point : amuse-bouches were disappointing, bread choice was pretty limited...We did not take the tasting menu so did not have the chance to sample that many dishes. Overall the feedback was positive but noone was really amazedSo nothing really to complain about, but I think there are many better options at this price in Paris;juin-16;Pur' - Jean-François Rouquette
6;"""Magnifique"" Amazing the best!!!";5.0;What a wonderful evening at Pur'The Chef immediately introduced himself at our Chefs table, and was very attentive asking if we had any food allergies etc. Wine pairings with dinner were excellent and the amounts were perfect to go with the tastings. Very original and spectacular courses throughout the meal. Very fair pricing considering this is a top restaurant at the Michelin level. Impeccable service. Amazing deserts. Highly recommend the chefs table where you can see really true artistry at work. Simply the best me am I have ever had. Viva la France ... Viva la PUR' !!!!!;juil-16;Pur' - Jean-François Rouquette
6;Lovely!!;5.0;This is by far the best restaurant I have been to. From food to service, everything has been impeccable and there really isn't anything I would change. Staff is lovely, the wine pairing was perfect, the cheese course was brilliant, really really lovely.We went for my partner's birthday and it was extra special. I would highly recommend going for the tasting menu as it's delicious. Looking forward to going back again.;mai-16;Pur' - Jean-François Rouquette
6;Premeire Dining Experience;5.0;This is an exceptional restaurant, in every way, as one would expect given the price and reputation. The food is outstanding, creative, and interesting. The service is top-notch. The atmosphere is formal but mostly comfortable. If you are looking for a find dining experience and are willing to pay for it, this is a definite must. Our only criticism would be that the food courses came out a little too early for our tasting menu. We are not sure if it is beause we are Americans, and they believe that is what Americans want, or if that is their normal practice. Otherwise, we had an exceptional experience.;juin-16;Pur' - Jean-François Rouquette

6;"Great food, nice location, but service so ""on the ball"" it was frantic";4.0;"Firstly, the food. Very very good. The choice was great, the quality was fantastic and the presentation was excellent. I was surprised at this level how limited the bread choice was, and how few little extras you got. But the meal itself was super good. The service was just frantic. Waiters buzzing round all the time, round us, round others, and so fast. I picked up the last morsel of bread off my plate immediately ""more bread sir"". I am undisciplined if its there I fill up on it so I wait and then have more later. ""Not now thank you "" The plate was taken. Not a problem but just an indication of how speedy and rushed it felt.But the food is still stunning!!!!";juin-16;Pur' - Jean-François Rouquette
6;Perfect;5.0;My friends and I have decided to try this restaurant after an extensive search. We have tried several Michillen stars restaurants previously in Paris and we wanted a one that won't disappoint. I would like to start by saying that it beat our expectations. The ambiance of the restaurant was excellent with very nice seating layout. The staff service was perfect. We opted for the 8 course testing menu which all were perfect. I'm a person with a sweet tooth so I can say that the desert was excellent.;mai-16;Pur' - Jean-François Rouquette
6;Memorable!;5.0;On our 5 days in Paris, we dined at two 1-Michelin star and one 2-Michelin stars restaurants. Chef Jean-Francois Rouquette’s Pur' Restaurant absolutely deserves its one Michelin star. Of all the Michelin star restaurants we visited in Paris, Pur' was our favorite. It is located in the Park Hyatt Hotel, and the place is refined and tasteful. Tables are well-spaced, so you have privacy to converse.We had the 6-course tasting menu with wine pairings. Food was exceptional, both in taste and presentation. The wines paired the food perfectly. This chef knows what he's doing. It is expensive, but not as expensive as the other Michelin star restaurants we visited in Paris on this trip. With a bottle of still water, two glasses of sparkling wine, the 6-course tasting menu with wine pairings for each of us, and two cappuccinos, the total came to 480 euros. That was money well spent.Honestly, on our next trip to Paris, the only Michelin star restaurant we would repeat is Pur'. Highly, highly recommend!;mai-16;Pur' - Jean-François Rouquette
6;Great experience;4.0;It was my first time dine at the Michelin starred restaurant. I was very surprised the service was so natural and smooth. The choices of wine that go with the dishes are excellent. I truly understand the meaning of being excited palate.;mai-16;Pur' - Jean-François Rouquette
6;Very good;5.0;Not as good as French laundry or the Meadowood but very good. Many of the courses I truly enjoyed and each you course you could tell was prepared with care and extreme thought to get every flavor and texture correct . I would definitely go back!;juin-16;Pur' - Jean-François Rouquette
6;Wonderful;5.0;We went to Le Pur' and had one of the best dinners of our life. Everything was just perfect - from the entrance , to the attentive staff and the wonderful sommelier, to the food... the food was just amazing. We took the 6-course degustation menu, with accompanying wine. Thanks a lot;juin-16;Pur' - Jean-François Rouquette
6;Amazing;5.0;As their name suggests Pur' meaning Pure, the restaurant is purely for a gastronomical experience.The food was exceptional and the service was excellent. Would definitely want to visit again.;mai-16;Pur' - Jean-François Rouquette
6;Dissapointing;2.0;My wife and I were very much looking forward to dining at Pur'. We made our reservation months in advance and indicated our dietary restrictions at that time. Unfortunately, our evening at the restaurant did not live up to our expectations. We ordered the 6 course tasting menu with wine. In order to comply with our dietary restrictions a basic lettuce salad (lettuce +dressing that's it) was subbed for one of the set courses, which was disappointing to say the least. In addition, most of the wines served with the meal were very young (2014's) and the courses were very heavy desert. All-in-all, we expected better from Pur', especially at their price point.;mai-16;Pur' - Jean-François Rouquette
6;Food scientist;4.0;"I will start by saying this was a very difficult review for me to write, as I feel the need to choose my words carefully. On one hand, the restaurant offered everything one would expect in this price range - excellent food, efficient service, etc. On the other hand, I tend to enjoy less formality and more personal interaction with the staff. For example - the team performed a well-choreographed ballet of movements throughout the evening, while I felt that some of them would have preferred to pull up a chair and get to know us (we would have preferred that as well). As such, much of the evening was full of formalities and arms-length transactions, as opposed to an immersion into French culture. Perhaps I was looking for such an immersion in the wrong place. There is no doubt in my mind that the chef and his staff work miracles with their food - I could only dream of cooking that well. But alas, we left with a feeling of ""ok, now we know what that was like, let's try something more 'local' next time.""Ps - we did the six-course tasting menu with the wine (perfectly paired btw) and left completely full after about 2-2.5 hours.";mai-16;Pur' - Jean-François Rouquette
6;Stunning in every way;5.0;My partner, who is a chef, and I recently stayed for a few nights in Paris. Wanting to try the best of the best, we had reserved a table at Pur' a few weeks prior to our trip. From reservation right the way through to walking out of the doors after our meal had finished was perfection. The food was outstanding. We had the 6 course tasting menu which blew us away and in addition the front of house staff were so attentive and professional. Well worth every penny and will definitely look to try here again;mai-16;Pur' - Jean-François Rouquette
6;Lovely;4.0;Great food, great staff. Even better atmosphere. Enjoyed our evening so much. Will recommend to any visiting the area.;août-15;Pur' - Jean-François Rouquette

6;Great food and service;5.0;We came for a dinner with my wife and an 8-month old baby. The food was impeccable - we had asparagus/crab cannelloni for a starter and sea bass/duck for the main. The staff was highly attentive considering our active baby, we were even allowed to place the stroller beside our table! We decided to skip the dessert but our waiter decided to bring us compliments from the chef;avr-16;Pur' - Jean-François Rouquette
6;Good experience;4.0;I came here for dinner with very high expectations. I was hoping to be blown away but unfortunately, the food left me a bit underwhelmed. The service, however, more than made up for it. The restaurant staff were all friendly and attentive, taking the time to explain the intricacies of the food and some of the ingredients. The wine was likewise delightful. If I had one complaint, it would be that the dining area was too dark.;janv-16;Pur' - Jean-François Rouquette
6;Tasty and beautiful!;5.0;The dishes were pretty and so tasty!Vine were ideal accompany our meals.Garçons were quick and very friendly.I like this place! Will return.;avr-16;Pur' - Jean-François Rouquette
6;Good place;5.0;Paris was always famous for its restaurants and Haute cuisine. This reputation was developed thanks to restaurants such Pur' - Jean-François Rouquette, that is able to take even an experienced gourmet on an unforgettable gastronomic journey. Balanced menu, exquisite design and helpful staff make this place unforgettable.;oct-15;Pur' - Jean-François Rouquette
6;Simply amazing;5.0;Unbelieveble food and service! An amazing experience, expensive but no doubt it is worth it! A great way to start our honeymoon in Paris.;avr-16;Pur' - Jean-François Rouquette
6;Front row seats to excellence.;5.0;In Paris, the competition in the fine dining category is fierce. It’s as if every night is a playoff game and everyone is gunning for the title. Here, a Michelin Star might actually be worth more than in other cities. And if you’re lucky enough to be on vacation, with back-to-back dinners at this level, you would imagine that someone has to lose. It was with this pressure we dined at Pur, having just experienced newly starred Saturne the night before. Would there be space for its unique take on starred excellence? Pur is a classic fine dining experience. This is not a let down. Imagine the finest ingredients in unique combinations. Now imagine them served at a level that take six dishes and create wonderful arc.While identifying individual dishes is useless as Chef Aie Okabayashi is sure to adjust the menu based on what’s seasonal, the one prevailing taste we encountered was “smoke”. Similar to the essence of barbecue, there were hits of smoke and wood in unexpected delicate places like fish. Yes there was a duck course that was one of the best…the skin by alone could have been a delicacy.Lest we forget, two of the six courses were desserts, with a palate cleanser that could be a dish in itself. Actually, the that cleaner tart “soufflé” was probably our favorite, and the pastry chef, who busily prepped dishes all night next to our chef’s table, humbly admitted it was his as well. We opted not to commit to the wine pairings, but the Sancerre and Margeux by the glass were excellent. If you prefer cocktails, their take on the Moscow Mule is worth the price. And don’t be intimidated by the six-courses. It’s the right size and takes about three hours, so it was well-paced. Finally, the service was superb. It doesn’t hurt that we were seated at the chef’s table with a window into the kitchen where Chef was making sure no detail was overlooked. And yes she made one trainee remake a simple amuse-bouche simply because he failed to sprinkle the dust in the right direction. And an anniversary cake for a couple celebrating theirs was reset because it sat a few minutes too long.Situated in the sexy Park Hyatt Vendome, this is far more than a “hotel” restaurant. It’s epic…they brought their A-game on an average Tuesday evening. But hey, this is Paris, and the next Michelin wannabe is right around the corner! The good news is that Pur has the goods, elegance and fine creations, to keep that star shining.;avr-16;Pur' - Jean-François Rouquette
6;Average;2.0;This is my first dinning upon touching down from Singapore. I had always enjoyed dinning in Paris and I am excited to try this restaurant after reading about it in Michelin Guide. First impression was that the restaurant was efficient but rather impersonal. All service staffs seems to be in a hurry ....but in a professional manner, going through the motion of introducing the dish and wine but sadly, lacking passion nor the desire to make a connection with the diner.Another thing that puzzled me...I had asked for the tasting menu only to be told that the 6-8 course tasting menu is NOT tasting menu but full portions...that does not make sense to me..I have dined in many a Michelin restaurants but this is the first time a tasting menu is not a tasting menu...puzzling!Food wise, ok. Not really outstanding. The first course of foe gras was slightly bland and flavors are mild. This was followed by the main course of blue lobster. The blue lobster is well cooked but too saltish. The accompanying angel hair pasta was good thoughThe next course was duck breast. I am Chinese and Chinese love our roast ducks and the roast ducks served in Chinese restaurants are flavorful, with very crispy skin and tender meat...so is the duck breast any good? Unfortunately, no...the skin is crispy (good) but minimal fat...so tasteless and the meat is tough...so, this is nowhere near those we have in Singapore...So, what is the best part of dinner...the wine. My conclusion...if this is not a Michelin starred restaurant, I would say good..But as this is a Michelin starred restaurant, then my expectations are higher and I am sad to say that this one disappoints for many reasons....the service is efficient but impersonal...the food is ok but not what I had expected from a Michelin chef. Would not come back again...;avr-16;Pur' - Jean-François Rouquette
6;Fantastic dinner;5.0;We had a memorable dinner at this place. We didn't try the 6-courses set menu because the hostess informed us that it's likely too big for us, so we ordered different starters and main dishes according to her recommendation. They were very helpful in letting us shared the plates. We'll definitely come back to this place.;avr-16;Pur' - Jean-François Rouquette
6;Wow.;5.0;What a fantastic treat it was to eat here whilst on a working trip. The food was stunning the service amazing the desserts OMG they were out of this world. The only down point is i can't go there every week but if I could I would absolutely superb.;nov-15;Pur' - Jean-François Rouquette
6;Great gastronomic restaurant in Paris;5.0;The service was on point, every needs have been fullfill. The food is Amazing. The menu is a bit expensive compare to other places with equal service but we took the dessert on the terrace and it was worthy!;déc-15;Pur' - Jean-François Rouquette
6;The full monty!!;5.0;I'm writing in english although i'm french so everyone can benefit.In a nutshell it is exactly what you can expect from such a restaurant. Flavours, textures, service... I ate the best beef in my life, the tenderness, the taste...GREAT service, wineYou can go there eyes closed;avr-15;Pur' - Jean-François Rouquette
6;Wedding Anniversary Treat;5.0;There should be no doubt that Michelin starred cuisine in Paris will be outstanding and Pur' did not disappoint. Service and food were both impeccable. I had requested a particular table in the dining room and it was exactly the one we were led to on arrival. Menus were offered in either french or english and staff asked if you preferred to be spoken to in french or english also. Our 7 course meal became more like 10 courses with the amuse bouche / pre dessert/ mignardises and each course seemed to improve on the last. The crowning dish for me was the chocolate dessert which can only be eaten to understand how fabulous it was! The only caveat at Pur' is the cost of the drinks. If, like us, a meal in such a restaurant is a special treat then perhaps your budget will not stretch to the price of the meal again in wine! A champagne trolley was bought to us on arrival and we were happy that we declined as champagne seemed to start from 75 eur a glass when we received the wine list! As it stood we had 2 gin & tonics which set us back 40 or 50 eur! We did of course expect the wine to be expensive but if you have a limit to your budget then it's nice to know how much you are spending in advance.This aside, Pur' was a very special experience and a wonderful way to celebrate our wedding anniversary.;sept-15;Pur' - Jean-François Rouquette
6;Beyond Exceptional;5.0;"Pur' is located a block or so away from the beautiful Paris Opera in the Park Hyatt hotel. My wife and I chose the 6 course dinner with a set menu. To be fair it felt more like 8 courses because of the additional ""samples"" in between courses. I actually don't know which was better-the outstanding, attentive service or the exceptional food and wine. My wife and I have traveled extensively and we both concluded that this will stand as one of the absolute best meals we have eaten anywhere in the world. My tips for travelers- do book in advance, recognize that in return for both service and dining excellence it is pricey, though I hasten to say what you get in return is well worth the bill. We will return to this restaurant again.";févr-16;Pur' - Jean-François Rouquette
6;Excellent Valentine´s dinner at the Chef´s Table;5.0;"We had a magnificent dinner her at Valentine´s day. I booked in advance and asked for the Chef´s Table. Knowing that it was just a short month until Valentine´s I thought this might be impossible in Paris, however we were very lucky. It says on the website it is for a minimum of four people but maybe they made an exception because of Valentine´s Day. The correspondence with the staff at Park Hyatt was as always a delight. Good service and very friendly.Upon arrival we instantly felt relaxed yet still excited. The hotel in itself is beautiful so and so is the restaurant. It was a perfect atmosphere/ambiance for couples. The Chef´s table in itself was beautiful. For the occasion it was rose petals on the table with a nice view straight to the kitchen through a huge open ""window"" so we could say hi to the chef and tell how much we liked it! :) So amazing to see them in action. The kitchen as well as the front worked seamlessly and in harmony making the experience quite exclusive and luxurious. They are all so friendly and made our dinner perfect. The menu set together for us was lovely. It was a fixed Valentine´s menu, but we had some demands as I have allergies towards certain things and my fiancé don´t eat meat. However we told this in advance and it was not a problem at all. We also took the wine package to go along with it and I must say that for all but one it was a perfect match. And the one that did not go perfect was still a 99%, so I am just being picky and difficult there. All in all it was amazing and I would recommend without a question. We even got a gift bag when leaving. I don´t know if that is common or just for that particular day, but it was a nice touch. Champagne and candy! We have been to a lot of restaurants during the years. Both fast-food and 3 star michelin restaurants around the world. However I must say that the overall feel here makes this the number one experience for us. The food, service, staff, table...everything made this the perfect and most memorable dinner we´ve ever had. So thank you everyone at Pur´ for that.";févr-16;Pur' - Jean-François Rouquette
6;Great place;5.0;Great food, great atmosphere, and fantastic service, I won't be forgetting this place anytime soon. It is a bit spendy though I think it's worth the price .-);févr-16;Pur' - Jean-François Rouquette
6;Best experience we have had at a resturant;5.0;My wife and I came here for our anniversary and were blown away. It was our first experience with fine dining and it did not disappoint. Everything was perfect from the food, service, and ambiance. The presentation was beautiful, the wine pairing fantastic. We got the tasting menu and the time just slipped away as we enjoyed our evening. I am not sure if there is anything they could of done better!;déc-15;Pur' - Jean-François Rouquette
6;Extraordinary experience!;5.0;We had our engagement dinner at Pur', and even though it was quite expensive, it was very much worth the money spent. We started of with some champagne and then had their 6 course tasting menu (which actually was more 10 courses) with wine package. We will definitely come back here.;févr-16;Pur' - Jean-François Rouquette
6;Overpriced drinks;3.0;I had high expectations for this place. The first issue is the need for me to confirm reservation the day before, otherwise it's cancelled. Second is as soon as we were seated we were not offered the option to look at other menus, and were told we already selected the prestige package. Then, we were offered Champaign which no one mentioned costs 30 euros a glass and tea which is 15 euros a cup. We weren't given a drinks menu which is leading me to think that they think we're tourists and therefore easy to fool. We're pretty well off but we're not made of gold. More importantly, I think the food wasn't anything special. They tried very hard to be different more than just making good food. I wouldn't come back, but I think if u do go, make sure u ask clearly for how much things cost, I just didn't think I'd get charged for a small cup of tea when I spend 200 bucks on a small tasting menu. In general felt nickel and dimed.;févr-16;Pur' - Jean-François Rouquette
6;A very nice first time!;5.0;First time me and my Girlfriend has ever visited a Michelin star restaurant! We had our expectations upped for this kind of priced dining, and we were still blown away by the level of service. The food did not quite match up to our expectations, but then again, we did not know what to expect. The whole experience was extremely satisfying, the food was exiting and both of us feel like repeating!We believe next time we will be more in-line regarding the food expectations.;janv-16;Pur' - Jean-François Rouquette
6;Fantastic experience;5.0;We were a dinner here for Christmas. From beginning to end it was a faultless experience. The food was absolutely sensational. There were little courses that were given but were included as part of the main price. Some came and explained the different champagnes. Someone else did the menu and then there were 2 waiters per table. You even got escorted to the toilets. Absolutely seamless experience. Nothing was to much trouble;janv-16;Pur' - Jean-François Rouquette
6;Great food but lightly dissapointed as a Michelin star restaurant;4.0;We had the opportunities dining at Pur as our first night in Paris. Overall, great food but maybe a little disappointed as a Michelin start restaurant. Don't get me wrong, overall, the execution, presentation and taste of the food are great. Service are great. Just I was expecting more at a restaurant at this scale. We ordered the pre-set 8 course meal. Originally, we had want to try the 6 course for me and 8 course for my husband but it appears that we can't order two different courses menu. I understand the course length may be different and it may be presented at different time, but I wouldn't think it would be an issue and I would be fine when presented at different time. Service is great but may seems a little rushed to clean our empty plate and serve the next one. Sometime, I wouldn't mind have a plate around and just chatted a bit. Food itself is great and every course is well through out. Sometime, the presentation overpower the taste. Overall, it is a great experience just as our experience we had with park hyatt.;janv-16;Pur' - Jean-François Rouquette
6;Great Cuisine;4.0;We truly loved this restaurant. We had the degustation menu with wine pairing and the food in quality and quantity was perfect. The service of was great except for one hiccup which left us a bit disappointed. We booked the restaurant a couple of weeks before and informed them well in advance that we want the set menu and that I am lactose intolerant. The host through emails confirmed that she will be talking to the chef to see how to accommodate. Arrived that night they informed us that the chef suggests not to take the set menu but a la cate. We have been to other high end restaurants and in all cases the chef recreated the menu to avoid lactose. So we were pretty disappointed as clearly a chef at such restaurants are able to do but we felt unwillingness here. We pushed backed voicing our disappointment and somehow then the chef accepted to accommodate. We were not expecting this to be honest in such high end restaurant. Nonetheless, the experience in totality ended up being a great one.;déc-15;Pur' - Jean-François Rouquette
6;Slighty disappointed;3.0;We went to Pur for my fathers 70th. It came highly recommended from friends in Paris (locals) as well as the reviews on various web sites. This review is purely my perspective on the restaurant. I'm sorry to say I was a little disappointed. When a restaurant is as highly acclaimed as Pur, with a Michelin star and the natural prices that comes with that you expect perfection. We have eaten in a number of similar graded restaurants around the world so have good comparisons to draw from.Firstly, the table linen is not the best cotton. I would expect a better quality of cotton. It was slightly course. Secondly, we went for the Christmas Set Menu with wine pairing (350 euro per head), and on a few dishes the dish was served before the wine.Thirdly, one of the courses was served when I was in the toilet.Fourthly, and most importantly I was not wowed by the food. It was certainly very good and well executed but it didn't surprise or wow me. It maybe that the tasting set menus outside of Christmas are better but im a true believer that a restaurant should maintain the highest standard at all times even on a quite night between Christmas and New Year.Lastly, I thought the service could have been better. It was very difficult to hear the very nice waitress when she described each dish, and there was a little rush/panic feeling amongst the staff. At a waiter brought bread to the table half way through the evening by mistake and took a quick 360 turn to walk away after realizing we had already been served bread at the start of the meal when it is due to be served.Overall, I was slightly disappointed. I would say they that there are plenty of fantastic reviews on various sites and even I have French friends in Paris who have had better experiences at Pur so it may have just been an off night given the day it was. I have to be true to my experience and though and say I would not recommend this restaurant and would look at others.;déc-15;Pur' - Jean-François Rouquette
6;Spectacular French cuisine;5.0;We ordered the 8 course menu which turned to 12. This Michelin starred restaurant is located inside one of the worlds best hotels. The service and food is definitely the most memorable parts of this restaurant. Every plate was beautifully presented with memorable delicious flavors. I would definitely visit again the next time I visit Paris.;déc-15;Pur' - Jean-François Rouquette

6;Amazing experience;5.0;My wife and I dined here at the end of August when we were visiting Paris at the end of August and this was probably the best dining experience (and most expensive) I've ever had. The 6 course tasting menu would have been plenty of food, but the dishes on the 8 course menu looked more appealing. The food was fantastic and the service was impeccable. I dropped my spoon into a dish and somebody was there to replace it within about 10 seconds, but it never felt intrusive. The squab was fantastic and the sommelier did a great job explaining each wine pairing.The only downside is it is expensive, but I thought the experience was worth it.;août-15;Pur' - Jean-François Rouquette

6;A Magnificent culinary experience;5.0;I took my wife to Pur' - Jean-Francois Rouquette for her special birthday. This isn't the type of place we frequent on a regular basis so when we do we want to be spoilt. The service is second to none, attention to detail second to none. I had a few requests re the menu as I do not like seafood. The restaurant looked after us with exceptional food superbly presented. There is not a thing I can find fault with. You do not always get what you pay for when choosing a special place to eat, in this case you get what you paid for with knobs on. Fantastic. Une expérience culinaire Magnifique;juil-15;Pur' - Jean-François Rouquette
6;Excellent French inspired food;5.0;"Pur is a restaurant located inside the Park Hyatt hotel, service of the hotel as you walk in until you get to the actual restaurant is excellent and really makes you feel welcomed. We got the ""Chef's table"" I think they call it, right next to and in full view of the kitchen, I didn't actually book this, but was really glad they gave us this table. We spoke to the head chef, Jean-Franois Rouquette during the night and he served us personally on most dishes, he even gave us an extra dish because he said we travelled so far to Paris (from Australia). We also saw the head pastry chef in action 1 or 2 feet from our table. This was a very enjoyable and memorable experience.The food is very tasty, I believe this is a Michelin starred restaurant. The flavours are subtle, but very good, there wasn't a bad dish in the degustation menu we ordered. Service was fairly quick as well (for fine dining), which we prefer, but that's a personal thing, it looked like they were monitoring each table to see their speed eating the dishes and timed the serving of dishes accordingly, as I saw people who were already eating when I got in and they were still being served as we left (we were there 2.5 hours). Their attention to detail in the food and service was impeccable. These are the little things that make a top fine dining restaurant even better. All in all, it was a very pleasant experience and will definitely return if I get the chance.";oct-15;Pur' - Jean-François Rouquette
6;Just Wow!;5.0;It was an exceptional experience form the reservation till the end of the meal. Everything ran smoothly. I found the restaurant to be nicely decorated.I went there for dinner so it was quite dimmed out but still very nice.The service was what you expect form Park Hyatt which meant the top standard. The staff were courteous and friendly without being intrusive nor too formal.I had the six-course menu with wine pairing and it turned out to be one of the best meal I have had. I appreciated the creativity of the chef who mixed Asian food with European one, like the Foie-Gras shabu, which turned out to be divine! The cheese was served in an utmost and unexpected way. I would recommend this restaurant to everyone. Really worth it!;oct-15;Pur' - Jean-François Rouquette
6;Pur' perfection!!!;5.0;Many of the Michelin star restaurants I have been to, the staff can be snooty and annoying watching your every move - well, not this one! They were friendly and down to earth and ever so accommodating, they were there when you needed them but not standing around your table watching you eat! It was the perfect mixture. Now the food, I can happily and easily say it was the best meal I have ever had in a restaurant. Just beautiful. We had a great view of the kitchen and we were able to see Jean-Francois Rouquette putting the finishing touches to each meal and working with his kitchen team. Great to watch him in action and taking such obvious pride in his work.The sea bass and the venison were out of this world. The desserts were just beautiful and a dish that really surprised was the Abalones- wowwey!!!! I must praise the incredible staff. We were eating there the night of the Paris terror attacks, the staff carried on as normal with such professionalism for a time that must have been very worrying for them. I also want to add, we asked for the wine pairing to be in half portions as we often struggle with finishing wines in time for the following dish but we still wanted a taste of of the paired wines. They happily obliged and just gave us much smaller portions on each one so we still got to try the glorious wine! What a pairing it was. It was perfect. A superb night I won't forget.;nov-15;Pur' - Jean-François Rouquette
6;Amazing;5.0;Do I need to say anything no .but i will ! We did not stay at this hotel but if we go back to Paris for a couple of days we will because of this amazing foodie delights the amazing ballerinas (waiters ) dancing around you in coordination together. They float with out a whisper of noise .the night we dinned their was a new born baby near by and 3 little children but the parents understood their needs and ours lovely to see thank you all;nov-15;Pur' - Jean-François Rouquette
6;Knockout!;5.0;Visited on Sunday with my husband for my 'significant' birthday and this place exceeded my expectations completely. Beautiful and elegant yet relaxing decor, extremely attentive service and a fantastic, varied tasting menu with wine to suit each course. Truly excellent fine dining without being aloof. Do not hesitate to book.;nov-15;Pur' - Jean-François Rouquette
6;Pure perfection for the food, the service and the location;5.0;This is my best meal ever. Everything was up to perfection. We didn't choose the degustation menu as we had a heavy lunch . We chose the A la Carte and selected the Langoustines in 3 servings, and the marinated Scallops as starters. We then had the wild Sea Bass and the garlic Scallops. We drank a white Hermitage Pilon 2012. I have no words to describe how good this dinner was from start to finish. The Maitre D, the sommelier, the Chef, the food, the wine, all perfect.Congratulations as it is very rare to find such perfection in a restaurant, wherever in the world.;nov-15;Pur' - Jean-François Rouquette
6;wonderful food, nice atmosphere;5.0;Situated in the Park Hyatt, this restaurant offers fine food in a beautiful setting. Very friendly and professonal staff. Ask for a table with view on the open kitchen. We had the 6-course menu, preceded by tasteful appetizers. Don't miss out on teh desserts, but only after having tasted the cheeses: all perfectly affinated. The only minor point: although the menus are reasonably priced for this type of restaurant in Paris, the wine list is rather expensive (and 99% french).;nov-15;Pur' - Jean-François Rouquette
6;Wonderful Dinner;4.0;We shared a very special dinner in this restaurant last Saturday. The service was top notch and totally unobtrusive. The food was exceptional with the langoustine and haddock starter and smoked chestnut dishes being of particular highlight and only one out of the 6 not really being to my taste. The wine matches were great and the sommelier was knowledgeable and personable. I felt it represented good value as 6 courses with matched wines, a glass of champagne to start and tea and coffee to finish was cheaper than a 4 course lunch at a 2 star restaurant that we had enjoyed a few days previously.;oct-15;Pur' - Jean-François Rouquette
6;Superb food, but a little pricey for what it was;4.0;Fine dining is my thing and I love to visit Michelin star restaurants. However a few little things could and should have been better. The food was great, but not exceptional. Service was good, but not out of this world. For the money I did expect a little better.;nov-15;Pur' - Jean-François Rouquette
6;Wow!;5.0;After dining at many Michelin stars all over the US, I was curious of what to expect from this place with there being so many Michelin starred spots in Paris. The Prestige menu which was 8 courses (plus others that were added which turned into roughly 12 or so) was a great deal. It included some amazing wine pairings as well which I wasn't expecting! Not bad for 195 euro when it comes to fine dining! I'm not going to go over every dish, but some of my favorites would be the roasted squab, the tortellini, foie gras lollipop and the amuse with caviar that was just so refreshing. This service was absolutely perfect in every way, and if you're debating on choosing this place, just go!;oct-15;Pur' - Jean-François Rouquette
6;Lovely;4.0;I booked Pur' for dinner because it's one of the very few Michelin-starred restaurants which open on Sunday. The restaurant is inside Park Hyatt Hotel on Rue de la Paix near Place Vendôme. From the very moment I entered the hotel, I was impressed by the beautiful design and the harmonious colour scheme. The same tastefulness extended to Pur'. The seating was very comfortable and all the staff very professional. The highlight was certainly the food. I took the 8-course tasting menu. The standout dishes included the langoustines, the white truffle tortellini, the abalones and the chocolate dessert. Since I felt a little bit ill, I didn't take any wine. But I noted there's a very wide selection of wine.;oct-15;Pur' - Jean-François Rouquette
6;Spectacular tasting menu;5.0;Spent the evening here with my wife and we chose the 8 course tasting menu. It was a delight and choosing the matching wines for each course is a must. Great staff, very attentive and knowledgable. We sat close the to kitchen which allowed us to see the food being prepared and masterfully executed and served. A fantastic experience and will not be forgotten.;oct-15;Pur' - Jean-François Rouquette
6;Exceeded all expectations;5.0;From the moment we walked through the door our experience here was unforgettable. A warm friendly welcome was followed by service that was second to none. Friendly staff with a wealth of knowledge was just the beginning. We had the 6 course tasting menu and the food was exquisite. From the appetiser all the way through to the final sweet our taste buds were never let down. I would highly recommend this restaurant to anyone who wants to experience both food and service that is second to none.;oct-15;Pur' - Jean-François Rouquette
6;Unbelievable;5.0;Everything about this restaurant was an amazing experience like I've never had. I've been to Joel Rubochon's L'atelier and this was better (albiet hard to judge just on taste). Partly because the service was impeccable and it was just a pure experience. We got the 6 course and they just kept bringing courses from the chef. All in all we got over 10 courses and it was all just amazing. Hands down the best restaurant I've ever been to.;oct-15;Pur' - Jean-François Rouquette
6;Simply put. Excellent;5.0;Absolutely faultless dining experience.The staff work hard to keep every customer happy.Allergies were catered for with ease.Every mouthful of food was an adventure.

6;Sensational;5.0;One of the best meals I have ever eaten. Well deserving of the Michelin awarding. Staff were numerous, and treated you like royalty. Sommelier was very knowledgeable and entertaining, and the food...... was amazing!!Will visit again no doubt.;nov-14;Pur' - Jean-François Rouquette
6;died, went to dining heaven, and came back;5.0;If you have ever wondered what it is like to eat in Michelin somber artistic formality, but feel you aren't trained for the experience and will make a fool of yourself, try this place. There's a kind of devotional commitment to the uninformed and ill at ease--this says nothing of the quality of the food, which is so fine there is a general agreement all around that there's no need here for punishing snobbery or efficious business like hustle-bustle. There's a serene quiet about the place, but it's warm and welcoming at the same time. Gracious is the word. Meanwhile, four or five people are standing at attention, to fill needs you didn't know you had if this is your first time doing this. The food is another matter. Divine delicacy and care, pointing towards fragility at times, inform the slow pace you find appropriate for moving through this taste extravaganza. Nothing is short of carefully thought through. It's an eating experience, and you cannot put a false step anywhere. The philosophy of this restaurant is to share the banquet of the gods with the people, those of us who can afford to dare try this level of epicure gastronomy. I'm very grateful to everyone who served me with kind but careful, respectful, conviviality. There was absolutely no difference in the amount of attention I received just the moment before realizing I wanted it, or peacefulness around me from when I came in, when it was empty at opening time, till when I left and it was full, three hours later.;juil-15;Pur' - Jean-François Rouquette
6;Superb food;5.0;Exquisite Michelin starred food prepared with incredible skill and attention to detail. Masses of complex flavours matched perfectly with some unusual wines (including a 27 year old dessert wine). Attentive and discreet staff. Overall a fantastic experience - although the price means it won't be a regular event!;oct-15;Pur' - Jean-François Rouquette
6;Great food, good service, but;5.0;Following the reviews on here, and in general I was very excited to take my partner to what I felt would be a gastronomic delight and I am pleased to say that the food could not have been more enjoyable.The foie gras lollipop's to begin with were a delight and every course that followed had a brilliant and inventive blend of flavours and fragrances.The service was exceptionally good throughout as well and the only slight regret I had was that having arrived marginally late for our 10pm booking we were somewhat rushed with the courses often arriving before the matching wines and then invariably with some of the previous wine still left. I appreciate we were at the end of the night but if I was to make a tip I would go early and I wish they would rather not offer the late booking if there is a desire to process you through so quickly.Otherwise though I heartily recommend.;sept-15;Pur' - Jean-François Rouquette
6;Take The 8;5.0;After dining at Bouley in NYC I have a new found love of French. This is one of three quite memorable dining experiences here in Paris. If you have the time just choose the eight course with wine and let this amazing sensory experience move you. Service is as you expect at any Michelin establishment, smooth, like a ballet of plates and stemware.;sept-15;Pur' - Jean-François Rouquette

6;This restaurant is rated third out of 14,000 in Paris, and there is a very good reason why!;5.0;I have dined extensively throughout my life, and this was hands-down the single most incredible dining experience of my life.

6;Excellent food, unparalleled service;5.0;"Went here with my boyfriend to celebrate our four-year anniversary, and had an amazing and luxurious experience from we arrived until we left. Without a doubt the best service I have ever experienced, the waiters were all extremely attentive and friendly without beeing intrusive. We both enjoyed the set menu ""Le temps qui passe"" with wine menu and were both very happy with our choice. Delicious food, lovely prepared with much attention to every detail. A night I will remember for a long time, definetly hope to come back here next time I vist Paris.";sept-15;Pur' - Jean-François Rouquette
6;Still really very good;5.0;Our first visit here earlier this year was such a memorable event that we had to come back. And we did, a few evenings ago. A second visit after a superb first one can be a bit of a let-down, and in a way it was for us, ever so slightly, but I think that's just because our expectations were so high.We booked for 20.00 and arrived at 19.50 - have to say I was a bit surprised to be asked to sit in the lounge area and wait 'for the restaurant to open' but OK. At 20.10 we were taken in and given the table I'd asked for - good start. We decided not to have the tasting menu as on our earlier visit but went a la carte. The girolles and abalone starters were great, so was my wife's lobster while my Wagyu beef dish was not quite the knock-out I'd expected. The wine we ordered was excellent - far from the most expensive on their list, still very, very good (Hautes Cotes de Nuits). Desserts were really good too.Service here was not quite as good as before - took a while to get attention, whereas before someone seemed to read our minds every time, also the explanations of the dishes were not always in the best English but that doesn't detract from the dishes themselves. (As a teacher of English, though, I really had to resist the temptation to correct the oft-repeated 'Have a nice degustation!')Well as anyone reading this will know, it's far from cheap, but it's a really good experience.If we go back, and I think we will, we'll take the tasting menu and that's what I'd recommend here.;sept-15;Pur' - Jean-François Rouquette
6;Great place.;5.0;Excellent experience. Definitely getting nice food and service for your money. I would recommend it for lunch and dinner too.;sept-15;Pur' - Jean-François Rouquette
6;Disappointing service;3.0;My husband and I ate here last night. Whilst the food and drink were excellent, the service, in parts, was disappointing. We chose the 8 courses with matched wines...was it correct that only 7 wines were matched with 8 courses? We questioned this with our hostess and she replied that there was no wine with the cheese course. No wine with cheese?!? The other thing was that service was slow. We were sat at our table on entering the restaurant and were not even spoken to until at least 10 mins...no drinks offered and no menu to look at, no eye contact or anything. It took 4 hours for our entire meal to be ordered and served in total. With a pre-dessert addition to the menu which indicated they were late on our next course (which neither of us wanted or appreciated). I'm sure they are a full restaurant most of the time - so surely they would have their timings right in terms of serving each course? All this being said the rest of the meal was enjoyable it's just that the amount of time it took dampened the evening.;sept-15;Pur' - Jean-François Rouquette
6;Absolutely wonderful;5.0;My husband took me here for my 40th birthday meal and it was quite simply one of the most amazing meals I have ever had.We each had the menu plus matching wines and I had no idea wine and cider could be matched so perfectly with the accompanying dishes.The staff were extremely professional and quite beautifully choreographed in their service. They were also friendly and gave no sense of the stiff, formal service that can sometimes be anticipated.A truly wonderful experience - highly, highly recommended.;mai-15;Pur' - Jean-François Rouquette
6;Best meal I have ever had hands down!;5.0;Wow! Is all I can say. This place is absolutely perfect in every sense but particularly the food! Came here for dinner after proposing to my girlfriend in Paris and couldn't have hoped for a more memorable experience anywhere! The food truly blew us away as did matching wines - I have been to degustation a number of times but this was truly on another level! Chapeu!;avr-15;Pur' - Jean-François Rouquette
6;Truly special;5.0;My husband and I went here for our tenth anniversary. We've lived in France and eaten at many great restaurants there. The experience at Pur was really special. The food was unparalleled among our restaurant experiences (as was the price but worth it!). The staff was attentive without being overbearing or condescending. They seemed to enjoy seeing our delight at the flavors we were tasting as much as we were! The sommelier made excellent choices and put serious thought into each one. The pairings were perfection. We will go back someday when we have another good excuse. thank you for a wonderful experience.;sept-15;Pur' - Jean-François Rouquette
6;Wow. The service!;5.0;"This restaurant is located in the Park Hyatt. A hotel restaurant, we were uncertain of how good it could be (even though it's a 1 star Michelin). We almost actually changed our dinner reservations, but since my BF's friend JUST proposed to his GF a couple hours before our reservation we kept it. Make reservations as the place was booked when we went and they have limited seating times. Dress is at least business casual. Although not required, almost all the men in the restaurant had suits on (so don't come in a polo!). Entire table must select the same pre-fixe menu.Trip Diary 5/7/20151: Dublin Bay Prawns from Pacific Island& Oscietre Caviar, Fennel Panacotta, Cucumber Jelly, Dill, Oil2: Duck 'Foie Gras' ""Shabu-Shabu,"" Soba & Rhubarb Stalks Tea3: Abalones w/ Parsley & Ginger, Cereal Garden4: Pan-fried Turbot w/ Salted Butter, 'Mimosa' Emulsion w/ Nasturtium Flowers, Saffron & Baby Leeks5: Saddle of Lamb Stuffed w/Marjoram &Smoked Paprika,Chichito Pepper, Ossau Iraty Gnocchi6: Refined Cheese Trolly from Marie Quatrehomme7: Damascus Rose Water, Wild Strawberry, White Cheese & Iced Hibiscus8: Grand Cru Croc Chocolate w/ Crunchy Caramel Pieces, Tonka Fava Flavored Dark Chocolate SorbetOur friends LOVED the meal and we all had a great time.

The thing we all agreed on being really good was the Foie Gras lollipop. All of us wished we could have more of it (even the non-foie-gras-lovers)! Such a whimsical way to eat foie gras and it had such a smooth center. The cheese trolly was fun as the waiter was kind enough to give us a small sampling of ALL the cheeses. Our own little cheese tasting :DAMAZING service and why I had to add a star! There's always someone nearby to attend to your needs. They'll even escort you to the bathroom so you don't get lost. Of course your napkin's folded when you come back to your seat and they'll push you back to the table when you sit down. Be sure to come hungry as they do not allow to-go boxes.";mai-15;Pur' - Jean-François Rouquette
6;Elegant and fabulous food;5.0;This was our first visit to this restaurant and we both thoroughly enjoyed it. Very relaxed atmosphere. Chilled even. Lovely setting. Staff were excellent. Very polite, personable and attentive. We took one of the tasting menus with accompanying wine flight. There wasn't a single weak course. Each one was beautifully plated and well balanced flavours and textures. I would definitely go back and I would not be surprised if they got a 2nd Michelin star.;sept-15;Pur' - Jean-François Rouquette
6;Special restaurant;5.0;This restaurant is for that special occasion. My wife and I went here for our 33 anniversary. We had the 6 or 8 course dinner with wine pairings. Everything was outstanding. If money is not a barrier and you are looking for one of the best restaurants in Paris, you will find it here.;août-15;Pur' - Jean-François Rouquette

6;The most amazing dinner we've had!;5.0;We visited Pur for my fiance's birthday in December. We read a lot of positive reviews but the experience surpassed our expectations.. by far. Although this is a fine dining restaurant, the staff were very friendly and accommodating which is not the always the case in such places.A fair warning, this is a 7 course dinner with some of the best food you will ever try, so go hungry and ready to eat. We ordered the steak as a main course and it was what I would expect a perfect steak would taste like. To paraphrase one of the reviews we read before going to Pur, if you want to ruin all your meals for the rest of your life visit Pur. Highly recommended! We would definitely visit again..;déc-14;Pur' - Jean-François Rouquette
6;Amazing!;5.0;"We chose this restaurant specifically to celebrate my husband's birthday. On arrival the staff offered their birthday wishes and led us to a very special table - the Chef's Table! From here you could see everything that was being prepared and the chef, Jean-Francois Rouquette was in attendance giving his approval to every dish before it left his kitchen. That in itself was an experience to see but the food itself was amazing. The presentation and flavours and textures were exquisite. The waiting staff are extremely knowledgeable about the menu and are very helpful in guiding you through the various choices. The service is impeccable but never cold and impersonal. Indeed they take great pride in presenting each dish to you and go to great lengths to ensure you enjoy the whole dining experience in their restaurant. Needless to say dining at Pur' is not an inexpensive evening. You have to be prepared to pay for the experience, but if it is a special occasion and you want to be able to look back and say, ""wow, do you remember when we dined at Pur' in Paris"" then save your Euros and book it! You won't be disappointed.";juil-15;Pur' - Jean-François Rouquette
6;Average in it's category;3.0;"Although you can't rate this establishment average in absolute category it is an average high end restaurant for wealthy tourists. Even in the same meal, flavours are not subtle balanced and carefully paired, aftertaste is oversaturated with intense and clashing combinations. Overall impression is that this is more like ""menu to impress"" than truly nurturing nuances that define superb and truly innovation in haute cuisine. Excellent service and fine wine list.";juil-15;Pur' - Jean-François Rouquette
6;A truly fine meal;5.0;"This restaurant deserves its Michelin rating. A fine, inventive tasting menu offering a wide variety of tastes and textures. Nice decor, comfortable tables nicely spaced apart. Attentive, first rate staff. Everyone spoke English well.My only small complaint - I expect a fine dining experience to begin with a warm, friendly greeting when we are seated. This didn't happen. As soon as we sat down, menus appeared and the drink service commenced. I would have preferred a bit of ""chit chat"" first, to set a more relaxed, cordial mood. But this was a minor oversight, as the rest of the evening was elegant and unhurried. I would visit again!";juin-15;Pur' - Jean-François Rouquette
6;Lovely International Dinner;4.0;The meal was delicious. The service was lovely without being perfect. It would have been stilted.I have a problem with the ambiance. Don't get me wrong. The room is gorgeous. Tables are well spaced. There is intimacy. Cushions are offered! My problem is that this lovely restaurant could be anywhere. Absolutely anywhere in the world. There is nothing that grounds the guest. Nothing that says that we are in Paris. I am not advocating a Parisian theme, but it is just too international.;juil-15;Pur' - Jean-François Rouquette
6;Excellent;5.0;We ordered the 6 course meal which impressed us by the flavour complexity and finesse shown in almost every course. Some of the dishes like the foie gras and the chocolate dessert were amazing. The service was prompt and not overly intrusive. Overall, great value for money and outstanding food that justifies a Michelin star, we will be back.;juil-15;Pur' - Jean-François Rouquette
6;Fun Surprises and Wonderful Flavors;5.0;"My daughter and I shared the six course meal at Pur for our last night in Paris on July 8. I thought I had made a reservation on-line, but when I called there was not a record of it so I was able to make a reservation over the phone, which was nice. We had excellent service for our entire meal. Our young waiter was extremely friendly, knowledgeable and was enjoying himself, which we appreciated. We never felt rushed, but every course appeared exactly when we were ready for it. It was a wonderfully orchestrated meal, as you would expect. We had salmon with crunchy fennel and a lovely veal with truffle, The first dessert course with wild strawberries was miraculous. It was the best, most interesting dessert experience I have ever had! Every bite melted together into a wonderful bite of complete strawberry flavor. It was amazing. The second dessert of chocolate ""croc"" was also good, but not as surprising. The only course we did not care for was the cheese course with a goat cheese with a jelly disc which was slightly disconcerting and not as pleasant a combination compared to the other wonderful flavor combinations of the menu. Overall, the experience was wonderful and highly recommended. It was one of my best dining experiences so far.";juil-15;Pur' - Jean-François Rouquette
6;Pur' Heaven in Paris;5.0;After reading the reviews from other foodies like me, I set up a reservation for four at Pur'. I am so much happier today for that. Pur' is as good as it gets. The food is exceptional and the service is what should be expected of a restaurant of this calibre. Jean-Francois Rouquette has created a magnificent French Gastronomical affair at his restaurant. We elected the eight course chef's premium selection with wine pairing and it made for the perfect centerpiece to our trip to Paris. We arrived and decided to have drinks at the bar adjacent to the restaurant located within the Park Hyatt. The mixologist at the bar (not just a bar tender) created some great drinks for us. I had an old fashion, which included vanilla and caramel liquors, that made the bourbon in the drink truly incredible. One of my all-time favorites now. When we decided to move over to the dinning room, the servers picked up our drinks and escorted us to the perfect table next to the open kitchen (truly subdued of all noise as if they all wore soft gloves and glided throughout the kitchen). It was great to view yet quiet and romantic at the same time. They start out with Champaign and a little palette cleansing plate along with three lollipop samplers - I don't know what they were, but they were great! Each course and wine pairing were spectacular, and each enhanced the entire culinary experience at Pur'. We truly enjoyed the experience, the service from a number of people that perfectly choreographed each move around our table, and the food, which made for a magical evening.;juil-15;Pur' - Jean-François Rouquette
6;Nothing is too much to expect;5.0;We had dinner here while staying at the Park Hyatt for 5 nights . The restaurant is everything one could want , and then some . My wife wanted the 7 course degustation , and I had my eye on two A La Carte items , which is usually very difficult for the kitchen to accommodate , but after asking the Chef ps aid they would accommodate us . The Chef started with a small gift of a fish dish , and due to the timing of the miss match of A La Carte/ degustation treated me to an additional tuna course so as to keep my wife and I on the same dining schedule .  The food was excellent as was the service, and 3 plus hours went by without us noticing, the sign of an excellent meal. Will go back next year, when we go back on our yearly jaunt to Paris .;juin-15;Pur' - Jean-François Rouquette
6;Excellent Food;5.0;I had a great dinner here with friends on a recent short trip to Paris. Pur is tucked into a corner of the Park Hyatt and is not a big restaurant. Table spacing however is generous and we never once felt that other tables were even there. Service was likewise excellent and more than happy to put up with a variety of dietary requests, exclusions and preferences. The food itself was superlative. We had the multi-course menu to try the highlights of the restaurant and each dish was fantastic. I'm not going to try detailing the individual dishes as your experience will differ anyway since they frequently change the dishes with the season. Suffice to say, the price (while high) was worth the experience.Two of our party had the wine pairing and were happy with what they got. They were probably much happier after the fifth or sixth glass so the pourings were generous enough. All in, a great place to go with friends who enjoy their food;juin-15;Pur' - Jean-François Rouquette

Booking online through TripAdvisor was really fast & simple and actually a lot cheaper.;juil-15;Pur' - Jean-François Rouquette
6;Amazing food, a few details still to improve;5.0;We had the 8 course tasting menu in this beautiful Michelin 1* restaurant inside the Park Hyatt. Every dish was excellent, most were really extraordinary. This was quite possibly the best meal I've ever had (and I have eaten at many great restaurants).From the first course of blue lobster on a bed of eggplant to three excellent desserts (ok, one was small and called predessert, but it was really good), we were amazed at the consistent quality. There was a superb abalone dish-I had occasionally tried abalone in Chinese places, but this was a whole other level. There was a veal generously covered with black truffles-here, as with the abalone, was evidence why people pay so much for truffles (and abalone). The wines served with the tasting dinner did not reach the same level. We chose the wine pairing, in part because the wines by the bottle were mostly really overpriced. The white wines served were decent, but not inspired or expensive enough to justify the 75 Euro per person wine cost, especially as the pours were not generous. The only red proposed was a light, almost herbacious nebbiolo, which we endured for the veal course, but when they wanted to give us more for the cheese course had to ask for something else. They brought a bordeaux that was much better. The service was overall excellent, with just a few things that could be improved. The waiters consistently couldn't tell us about the ingredients of the dish, and even when they went back to ask a chef usually still didn't really answer our questions. We were also initially refused two relatively simple requests by our waiter, which he then accepted (the addition of a small part of a dessert that was on the main menu but not the tasting menu-he said absolutely not possible, then when dessert came it was there. he initially refused to let us take home the small petit fours given after the meal, then brought a box for us). But really in the end, it's about the food, which was wonderful. Maybe when the wait staff is a bit more experienced and with a few bottles of better value on the wine list, Michelin will give them the 3 stars the food deserves!;juil-15;Pur' - Jean-François Rouquette
6;Unbelievable for Hotel to have this great of a restaurant!;5.0;Had the Chef's table and the experience of the night was near perfection! The gorgeous hostess never let us push our own chairs in and the brilliant chefs never disappointed with the food!

6;Amazing!!;5.0;Our trip to Pur' last night was amazing. We only had one night in the city and I agonized over the perfect place to have our anniversary dinner. I have yet to be too disappointed with trip advisor recommendations so after comparing the top 10, I decided Pur was going to be a good fit for my husband and I. Im so glad I choose this place!!! We did the 8 course tasting menu with wine pairings and were delighted from the moment we walked in the door. Every detail of our meal was well thought out.

Not only was the food and the service exceptional, but for some reason, we were lucky enough to be randomly seated at the Chef’s table where we could actually watch the food preparation in detail. We elected to go with the Chef’s tasting menu which they happily adjusted to accommodate some of my wife’s seafood aversions. Every dish was amazing.

I opted for the 6 course degustation. 3 amuse bousche came first and they were ok. The 1st course was white asparagus. Not a big fan, but it was ok. Seabass followed and it was good and well coordinated with all the other elements. Veal was the main and it was very good. A heavy melted cheese course followed. It was ok but too heavy and cheesy to finish. The strawberry and chocolate desserts finished the set and they were great. Petit fours were also too much for me by thenService is very good as expectedPur-fect;juin-15;Pur' - Jean-François Rouquette
6;Lovely Tasting Menu;4.0;Dined here with a group of six and seated at a lovely table. Tasting menu was delicious and wines excellent. Waiter staff generally good but one cleared our champagne glasses away with 1/2 a bottle left then when asked had to get more. Not blown away but a lovely night was had by all.;mai-15;Pur' - Jean-François Rouquette
6;An unforgettable Evening;5.0;"I am not one of those who can be impressed easily and one who is keen to send review. But after this experience I had t share it. I have been at Le PUR' from Jean Francois Rouquette last week for my anniversary. I have to say that after reading so many positive comments, I set my expectations very high. So I arrived and was greated by a young lady (don't remember the name) with a lovely french accent in a very well groomed manner. I was escorted to this beautiful room. We took recommendations of the experts and went for the 6 courses menu with wine paring. I admit that all was perfect specially the lamb which was paired with a beautiful rioja. the brie de meaux ""chef's version"" paired originally with a cider, wow!!!. I still feel the aroma and the flavor on my tongue as I recollect. Service was very attentive and attention to detail was impeccable. Really impressive! Discussing with the service team I was surprised to know that the restaurant was only award with one michelin star...I am certain this place will be getting more starsI highly recommend this table.";mai-15;Pur' - Jean-François Rouquette
6;A true Guide Michelin experience;5.0;Fantastic from start to finish!Started with sending an email asking if I could get their 6 course dinner without meat. That was no problem.When we arrived we got some starters on the house and directly they knew that I did not eat meat. They changed the meat dish to a fabolous fish dish that was created by the chef and not on the menu.Fantastic food and fantastic service and fine-dining where you can rely on being full as well without getting ruined.Highly recommend this place, a true experience!;mai-15;Pur' - Jean-François Rouquette
6;Outstanding;5.0;My boyfriend and I ate here for my birthday and absolutely loved it. We had the tasting menu, which was perfectly designed and each dish was amazing, in particular the veal sweetbreads. The expectations are high in this type of restaurant but it really did not disappoint. In addition, the décor was beautiful and the service warm and attentive.;mars-15;Pur' - Jean-François Rouquette
6;Food Lives Up to the Show;5.0;"Pur' is the sort of ""pull out the stops"" hotel restaurant that could easily earn 5 eye rolls instead of 5 stars. Lots of staff, lots of choreography ... often the sign of a place that is more flash than substance. But Pur' has the goods and delivers in every way. As is often the case at high-end restaurants the tasting menu is much better value than ordering a la carte. The wine pairings were intelligently selected and fairly priced. All of the food was excellent, of course. Some of the dishes, such as the white asparagus, were simple and remarkably fresh. Others, such as the foie gras lollipop, were surprising and simply cool. All of the staff were exceptionally nice and - as is typical in a hotel - spoke excellent English. Pur' would be a great first restaurant for anyone who wants to experience high-end French cuisine but finds it a little intimidating.";mai-15;Pur' - Jean-François Rouquette
6;Perfect.;5.0;"Dined as a party of two, and ordered the ""as time goes by"" tasting menu. The food and service were exemplary, and the courses held many delicious surprises. We were quite impressed. The turbot and sorbet were highlights of the experience.";mai-15;Pur' - Jean-François Rouquette
6;Excellent, highly recommend;5.0;This restaurant came recommended and it did not disappoint. The 6 course meal was exquisite, the service was top notch, and the ambiance was so;mai-15;Pur' - Jean-François Rouquette
6;WOW * WOW * WOW;5.0;The food and matching wine were wonderful. The array of flavours were sublime and left both my friend and I in a state of euphoria. Excellent meal, wonderful service, we will return!;mai-15;Pur' - Jean-François Rouquette
6;Exceptional dining experience;5.0;We booked a reservation at Pur to celebrate our 40th anniversary with a really special experience, and this Michelin-starred restaurant delivered.The atmosphere is elegant without being stuffy. I wore a jacket and tie and my wife was fashionably dressed, but other patrons were more casually dressed. The lighting is soft, there's much more space between tables than in most Parisian restaurants, and its quiet enough to converse without raising your voice -- also a rarity in our two-week visit to Paris.We ordered the 6-course prix fixe menu, and it was everything we expected it to be. From the little amuse bouches to the final bon bon at the end, everything was artfully and exquisitely prepared, with complex flavors and colorful plating.My wife ordered the wine pairings, which the wine steward introduced with a description of its origins and flavor highlights. She's developed a very refined palate and judged them all to be excellent wines well matched to each dish. The rest of the service was excellent, too, attentive without being intrusive. The pacing of the courses was perfect, neither rushed nor too slow.My only ding is that I felt the prices for the non-alcoholic beverages were out of proportion: 52 euro for two bottles of Evian and two non-alcoholic beers! I thought the dinner and wine pairings, at 135 and 55 euros, respectively, a much better value.;mai-15;Pur' - Jean-François Rouquette
6;Pur-ring Chat!;5.0;Wow, last night in Paris and this was the top for me out of all the three restaurant, all Michelin starred. From the moment we arrived, I felt like someone special. Staff are smart, engaging, know their menu better that their back of their grandmothers hand. Ambiance is evening classic. Tables are nicely positioned, not intrusive but you can see the whole restaurant before you. Starters were fantastic, mains outstanding, have any of them they are so good. And choice of wine, priced right for the quality. Love it. Would go back every month if I could afford it.;mai-15;Pur' - Jean-François Rouquette
6;Tête-à-tête civilized;4.0;Outstanding food starting with lolly pops of foie gras, a fire work in your palate. From starter to dessert a real enjoyment. Only the turbot had not much of taste and the cheese course I rank it not as top. However overall well done. The wines recommended with each course was well matched and professionally explained by the sommeliere.The service was in my opinion too stiff and gave me the impression of being stressed. Little breaks between courses would have been appreciated, some moments of being rushed came up in my mind.The ambiance is perfect, worth to come back.Overall a great venue with outstanding food.;mai-15;Pur' - Jean-François Rouquette
6;Perfect Fine Dining;5.0;We had a dinner on Pur' for a special occasion, everything was perfect, service, ambiance, dishes all was 5 star. We had 6 course tasting menu and it was a never ending culinary journey that lasted for around 3 hours, addition to 6 course, lots of side dishes was served as a complimentary, actually it was too much to eat at one night so be sure to be very hungry to order tasting menu.;mai-15;Pur' - Jean-François Rouquette
6;Best Meal of My Life;5.0;"My wife and I ate the ""As Time Goes By..."" tasting menu last night at it was the best meal of my life (bumping Daniel in New York City). The white asparagus was so good that if I knew how to prepare vegetables like that, I'd likely be a vegetarian. I couldn't give this restaurant any higher praise. The service is also (of course) outstanding.";mai-15;Pur' - Jean-François Rouquette
6;An unbeatable evening;5.0;Wow what a dinner!The 8 course tasting dinner was one of the best meals we have ever eaten and the service both in the restaurant and in the Hyatt generally was congenial and exceptional. Some of the dishes were try's works of art that it was a struggle to disturb in order to eat them because they were so beautiful. Favourites include the Dublin Bay Prawns, turbot, lamb, cheeseboard and the chocolate. Thank you for a memorable evening beyond all my expectations. Superbe!!;mai-15;Pur' - Jean-François Rouquette
6;a real experience;5.0;everything was very very close to perfection- from presentations to musics- it was a very nice experience to taste the menu. wines were also the good matches. the chocolate dessert is a thing that will be in my mind for a long time! the prices are high comparing to fine dining restaurants. but i'd like to reexperience in some years.;nov-14;Pur' - Jean-François Rouquette
6;wonderful experience;5.0;The food was inventive, beautiful and delicious. The hospitality of the staff was wonderful and we were fortunate enough to sit at the Chef's table. We had one course after the next of delicious plates and I got the opportunity to try abalone for the first time! The cheese course was incredible as well and the desserts were wonderful. If you get a chance go to Pur!;mai-15;Pur' - Jean-François Rouquette
6;Perfect Birthday Dinner;5.0;Everything was perfect from the beginning (the sweet richness of foie gras contrasted with an exquisite tart mango!) to the grand finish in a parade of desserts I thought might never end. We selected the six plat menu and enjoyed attentive yet unobtrusive service. When I had a question about an ingredient with which I was unfamiliar, the server brought it to my table so that I could better understand its preparation, which I appreciated. We thought that the wine pairings were an excellent value and very well done. The courses themselves were inventive and the flavors played off of each other in unexpected ways. This experience was a perfect way to savor and celebrate a special milestone. I am thankful we chose a long walk home, however! It's quite a lot of food!;mai-15;Pur' - Jean-François Rouquette
6;Amazing Pur;5.0;Just a fabulous experience, staff were outstanding and the good was even better. Some of the best dishes if had around the world. Cost 500 euro for 8 course set menu with matching wine. Great value and will go back when I'm back in Paris.;mai-15;Pur' - Jean-François Rouquette
6;AN ENJOYABLE EXPERIENCE;4.0;Our visit to this restaurant exceeded our expectations and we felt it should have at least another Michelin Star.The food was superb and the wines matched perfectly ( we had the six course menu), the ambiance just right and the staff very welcoming and attentive. It's on our list to visit again if we are in Paris.Many thanks to the team.;avr-15;Pur' - Jean-François Rouquette
6;Nice venue for special occasion;4.0;In Paris for a friend's birthday. Great service (more staff than customers). Faultless food. Just one little crib. Main dish served in a bowl and knife and fork kept falling in, so had to deal with soiled handles.Bring back the plates! Staff were more than helpful and made us feel very welcome. We even got a little gift leaving;avr-15;Pur' - Jean-François Rouquette
6;Beautiful dining experience for wife's 30th;5.0;We visited Pur' for my wife's 30th birthday and decided to have the 'As time goes by' tasting menu. The food and service was exquisite, more of what you'd expect from a 2 or 3 Michelin starred restaurant in the UK than what is only a 1 star in Paris. At €125 this is good value compared to other restaurants of a similar standard in Paris.The menu was excellent and each course was a delightful experience full of great flavours and textures. The service was commendable and with only one sitting you have the table for the whole night. This is a restaurant for a special occasion and a wonderful experience that will will not forget. Thanks to Jean-Francois and his team. It was a pleasure.;avr-15;Pur' - Jean-François Rouquette
6;Disappointed;3.0;After reading the reviews on Trip Advisor, our anticipation was high. The layout and feel of the restaurant was very similar to Gordon Ramsay's Petrus (which we thoroughly enjoyed) but it fell flat on service (too obtrusive and the staff outnumbered the patrons) and the food too mediocre, with too much of an emphasis on desserts, for this class of restaurant. Sigh.;avr-15;Pur' - Jean-François Rouquette
6;Fantastic. can it possibly be better?;5.0;"We had a romantic dinner at Pur'. We both had the 6-course set menu without wine for 125 Euro each (with wine it's 190 Euro). In addition to the courses, which include foie gras in a soup, fish, veal sweetbread, cheese, and 2 desserts, there also 3 amuse bouches, a pre-dessert, and a small finishing dessert. They also give you several small cookies to take home. All the courses are fantastic! (a word of warning: the veal ""sweetbread"" is neither sweet or bread -- you might want to google it beforehand). Service was excellent. All the staff speak great English and were extremely courteous. We walked out with very full bellies and very happy feeling -- hmmm life is good. It's not cheap but excellent value for the food, the ambience, the service and the Michelin star (I personally think it should have 2 Michelin stars...)";mars-15;Pur' - Jean-François Rouquette
6;Ticks every box and more!;5.0;From the champagne to the taster courses with an excellent finishing touch delivering a rare branch of coffees. Completely worth the experience and very reasonably priced meal. We left wanting more and with memories like a box of chocolates without the sweety guide - we just keep coming across different and extraordinary thoughts from it all.Superb! Thank you Pur' - Jean-Francois Rouquette.;mars-15;Pur' - Jean-François Rouquette
6;Fantastic!;5.0;Wow! Pur was really a fantastic experience. We celebrated an anniversary and this was the perfect place for it. The food (abalones/asparagus for starters, duck/beef for main) was great, as where the wines and the Blue Mountain coffee. The service is great, really great, and it's especially nice to be at star restaurant in Paris and feel welcomed and truly cared for, as opposed to the sometimes slightly nose-in-the-air attitude. Pricey (we paid ~650euro for 2), but worth it.;mars-15;Pur' - Jean-François Rouquette
6;Pur'fect;5.0;"The decor reminded me of a creme caramel brulee but that aside, this was my first visit and the restaurant had come highly recommended I do not think I have had Fish Jelly before, but the Dublin Bay prawns were excellent and the combination was great, however the ""Wagyu"" beef that followed would be worth walking over broken glass for, how the chef managed to package so much flavour into this dish even weeks later still surprises me.Then the Lemon Opaline, such texture";févr-15;Pur' - Jean-François Rouquette
6;Exquisite meal;5.0;Absolutely amazing experience from the champagne trolley, to the most delicious 6 course tasting meal - not to mention the accommodating chef so I didn't have to eat sweetbreads. We have dined at some of the best around the world but this meal by far beat our experiences at the 3 mich star restaurants in California. Oh and I should also mention the great service!;mars-15;Pur' - Jean-François Rouquette
6;Sunday dinner;3.0;One of the few venues open for Sunday dinner but rather perfunctory rushed service that was unexpected for a Park Hyatt.Meal itself satisfactory but not notably better than most equivalent restaurants.;févr-15;Pur' - Jean-François Rouquette
6;Nothing to pick on ....;5.0;We chose this restaurant mainly because it is located in Park Hyatt Paris-Vendôme.However, its cuisine was really creative and amazing.The cooking way and the sauce didn't destroy the ingredients themselves, but to highlight them.I like this simple but brilliant way.I was most impressed by the main course sweetbread and the dessert.The sweetbread had a crispy surface but it was tender inside. And the sauce had a good balance between saltiness and sweetness.The dessert was perfect.The first dessert was a mixture of every different sour, which let us fresh our taste.The second dessert was a harmony of different taste of chocolat.Sweet and bitter, creamy and crispy.The taste was abundant and full of change.Although Pur' is now a Michelin one-starred restaurant, I look forward to its future.... As long as its quality didn't decline. And also, the waiters should be more respectful to foreign guests, not just treat us like tourists who don't know the quintessence of the French cuisine.;févr-15;Pur' - Jean-François Rouquette
6;Top quality dining!;5.0;Booked a table as a treat to celebrate our 10 year wedding anniversary after reading so many amazing reviews on Trip Advisor and I must say Pur lived up to our very high expectations.We both chose the six course tasting menu but as neither of us eats pork, shellfish or offal, a couple of the dishes had to be substituted. This was not a problem, the staff were very accommodating. Speaking of staff, they could not have been more attentive. There must have been half a dozen waiters looking after us, serving bread, topping up our water & wine and even escorting me to the toilet!As for the food itself - outstanding! Portion sizes were just right and the pace of the meal was spot on too. we spent approx 3 hours dining which for us was about right, not rushed with just enough of a breather between courses. Every course served was a culinary delight but I have to make special mention of the melt in your mouth foi gras and the lemon sorbet dessert which were truly outstanding.As well as the plates listed on the menu there were regular surprises served up throughout the evening in the form of amuse bouches and even a little take home goodie bag.All in all, a highly recommended fine dining experience!;févr-15;Pur' - Jean-François Rouquette
6;Superb;5.0;Like almost all the previous reviewers, I can only add superlatives. We had the 6-course tasting and chose wine separately (aided by helpful sommelier). Both the food and the service were fantastic - from amuse-bouche, through fantastic turbot and delicious venison (they were quite prepared to make this change to the set meal for us), absolutely one of the best dining experiences we've had. And at E125.00 a head (without wine), excellent value too in my opinion given the amount and quality of the food.Atmosphere is relaxed, service never obtrusive but never lacking and always with a nice personal touch.Highly recommended and we will definitely go back next time in Paris.;févr-15;Pur' - Jean-François Rouquette
6;Ridiculous from start to finish in every way.;5.0;We had the degustation with wine accompaniment... the food, the wine and the service was world class.Better than some 2 and 3 star places that we've been to. THAT good!The water and post-dinner drinks were more punchy in price than was necessary though.A wonderful evening and experience which was ridiculous from start to finish in every way... including the bill.;févr-15;Pur' - Jean-François Rouquette
6;Amazing Valentines Meal;5.0;My boyfriend and I came here and had the valentines menu on Saturday. We were so impressed with the setting, food was outstanding and service was second to none! Every course was delicious and also interesting on the palate, we had pink champagne which was recommended and really went with the meal and occasion. The staff were so attentive but also very friendly not stuffy like you may expect. We would recommend to anyone wanting a special meal in the romantic city of Paris! Also upon leaving we were giving a gift of a half bottle of champagne, rose and handmade marshmallows which I thought was delightful :) thoroughly impressed.;févr-15;Pur' - Jean-François Rouquette
6;Excellent food, efficient service;5.0;We had the degustation with wine accompaniment. The food was excellent, good quality, well presented. Wines were well matched.I would like to have seen more meat on the menu.This is a great restaurant inside the Park Hyatt Vendome hotel.;févr-15;Pur' - Jean-François Rouquette
6;Almost faultless;5.0;Amazing evening food to die for and faultless service. My only issue was not being able to identify if a service charge was added to the bill ? No option was made available on the card machine which caused an embarrassing pause before leaving. Wonderful food experience overall, highly recommended.;févr-15;Pur' - Jean-François Rouquette
6;Stunning!;5.0;We visited Pur on Saturday to celebrate our 20th anniversary. The whole experience from start to finish was absolute perfection. We were looked after with a professionalism way beyond a 1 star restaurant! We went for the 8 course taster menu with matched wines. It was simply stunning, it is certainly the best meal and dining experience we have ever had, from the amouse bouche to the hand made chocolates with the coffee. The favourites for me were the cauliflower risotto with black truffle, and the turbot. Every course was exceptional, and I cannot recommend this restaurant and the staff enough! Would love to go back!Stunning!Julian;févr-15;Pur' - Jean-François Rouquette
6;Highly recommended;5.0;Everything about this is six star dining, We had an amazing dinner. great service and stunning food. every mouthful was wonderful and left us with memories to last a life time. The parting gift of the brioche was delightful too. Highly recommended.;janv-15;Pur' - Jean-François Rouquette
6;Great New Years eve dinner;5.0;Our experience at Pur was perfect. We dined on New Years eve 2014 and we were really blown away by the experience. Based on our past experience dining out on New Years eve we have come to expect hurried service and poorly executed food. What we found instead was a meal and wine that were close to perfection. From the moment we entered the restaurant we were treated well by a highly attentive staff. The room was tastefully decorated for the evening and we were offered a special champagne cocktail to start. All of the courses were well executed. Most memorable were the exquisitely prepared venison and the desserts. The star was a round dessert made of red colored white chocolate that was filled with a sorbet and nut mix. Truly exquisite. We felt that every course was well executed and demonstrated the skills of the head chef. My only concern was the price. This was one of our most expensive meals in Paris at 700 euros/person (everything including wine selections was included). This was a memorable meal and truly an experience that we will never forget.;déc-14;Pur' - Jean-François Rouquette
6;The perfect evening and a foodie's dream dinner;5.0;I recently brought my sister to Pur' to give her the evening of a lifetime and celebrate. We enjoyed the 8 course menu with wine pairings. The entire meal was a delight to all of our senses and we enjoyed every course. The foie gras stew with black truffle and duck scratchings was our favorite course. It was so subtle, flavorful and delicious we both wanted more. The service was also absolutely wonderful. I will definitely recommend the restaurant to other travelers and come back again the next time I am in Paris. An AMAZING dinner!;janv-15;Pur' - Jean-François Rouquette
6;What a meal!;4.0;"Located in the Park Hyatt Hotel of the Place Vendome , you must try this 8 courses surprising menu! (125euros)It was just amazing. The first dish was Foie Gras scalop cooked in its ""bouillon"": a wonder!Then came the turbot with all sorts of flavors... ended up with 3 desserts, just terrific!The staff is absolutely perfect and we thank JF Rouquette, the Chef, who came to give us explanations concerning different spices.Will certainely go back soon!";janv-15;Pur' - Jean-François Rouquette

6;Fabulous evening;5.0;We ate at Pur on Christmas Eve and absolutely enjoyed the evening. The Christmas Eve set menu was memorable and the wine parings perfect. Our daughter is a vegetarian and the chef adjusted her courses accordingly. The service was warm, at times humorous, and always informative and helpful. Our family had a wonderful meal!;déc-14;Pur' - Jean-François Rouquette
6;Spectacular.;5.0;The tasting menu is a gastronomic firework display. Attention to detail. Balance of flavour. The love and even sense of humour that has gone into each mouthful is jaw dropping. I would definitely recommend this restaurant to any traveller. Such friendly and courteous staff. Cocktails in the bar need a mention as the were both innovative and very tasty. My girlfriend and I both left there on a high.;mars-14;Pur' - Jean-François Rouquette
6;Faultless;5.0;"We had the single best bite of our trip in Paris here. It was a venison ""hunter's pie"" served as part of a venison two-ways main course. The other part was the most perfectly cooked piece of venison I have ever had, but the pie was life changing. I had never had venison served in a shredded bbq-esque presentation before, nor had I have had mashed potatoes with white chocolate. Now I wonder how I could have missed out on such a genius combination for so long. I will never see mashed potatoes the same way again.Like the Park Hyatt hotel itself, where I stayed, there's really nothing to fault about my meal here. If anything, the amuse were just fine (but interesting and creative), and then the meal just kept building strength upon strength. The desserts were astoundingly good. The only negative I can think of is that I had way too much food (and wine), and almost fell asleep. But then the pre-dessert refresher did it's job at waking me up for the actual desserts that pushed our meal past midnight.Many reviewers suggest another star will be awarded to Pur' in time, and it's not hard to see why. It really felt like a 1-star restaurant cooking above its level, and therefore it was almost a relative bargain, if you can call a E200pp+ meal that. And if you're staying at the Park Hyatt already, it is also crazy convenient to stumble back into bed!";oct-14;Pur' - Jean-François Rouquette

6;Fantastic experience.;5.0;My husband and I enjoyed a perfect night out at Pur'. We both ordered the 6 course degustation menu - everything was perfect and we loved all dishes. The foie gras stew was a perfect start of the journey - it was rich in flavor yet light in texture. I also loved how the duck scratchings on top added another level of texture and flavors to it. Turbot was cooked perfectly - probably the best I've had ever. Venison entree was nicely done - as I was pregnant I had it done medium this time, but next time I'd go medium rare as the meat was rather lean. Comte cheese I also enjoyed very much - typically I'm not a cheese fan but this aged Comte is rather mild but rich in flavors. chef's added touches made it even tastier. The final 2 desserts - the passion fruit meringue with caramelizes banana and the chocolate desert - were also heaven. My husband didn't ordered the wine pairing but asked the waiting staff to recommend a white and a red to go with the menu. He was very pleased with their choices. Prices for the wine is indeed high (17~18 euro per glass) but we sort of expected that. We were however a little bit shocked by the price of the champagne he had prior to dinner - it was indeed a very nice blanc de blanc but 49 euros still seemed too overpriced.Service was efficient and professional. At first we felt it was a bit cold and distant (compared to restaurants of similar level in Italy where we just came from) but it got better after a while - they seemed to always be very busy but still made the efforts to make us feel welcomed. We left very satisfied and well fed. Will definitely come back and recommend it to our friends.;déc-14;Pur' - Jean-François Rouquette
6;incredible restaurant and only one michelin star;5.0;i was with my wife and my uncle,after a long debate we decide to eat at Pur restaurant and wasn t a mistake.Atmosphere was great,service also.great food.....nothing to comment.the staff knew all about the courses brought to us.Warmly recommended for a unforgettable evening .i will put some pictures.starting with the champagne ,an amousse bouche with fois gras ball and cranberries reduction.and some of the degustation menu....every course was tasteful.If i remember well ,we had taken 2 degustation menu 6 courses with paired wines and a la carte menu for the third person.(with cheese cart , wagyu beef....which seemed to me extraordinary till i was in japan a few month later where i had eated real wagyu beef which was awesome... and has nothing to do with wagyu beef which i have eat in 4th restaurants in Europe).but ..at Pur you will find a high class restaurant where you will enjoy every moment...but...the bill....is quite tough ..we paid 800 eur for three persons..but worth it,it s my opinion .;juin-14;Pur' - Jean-François Rouquette
6;Magnificent;5.0;"First day in Paris,jet lag,in jacket but blue jeans and near the plaza Vendome with my wife. It's 8pm take out my Michellin guide and decide we deserve a Michellin star restaurant. So there's Pur,at the Hyatt Vendome,and have the audacity to walk in and see if I could get a table for two. I'm ready for the famous Parisian ""Monsieur pas possible""....but,what...a smile and a wonderful table for two!From there its a great experience. Food was magnificent.for many years I had never understood why Kobe beef was so great until I had Kobe beef that literally melted in your mouth in this restaurant. The menu is not typical French food. I would call it international cuisine,but it's of a very high quality. Service as I said is very friendly,efficient and ready to please. Now,beware,you will have a hearty bill. Dinner for two with wine and desserts was around $700,it's not for the faint hearted. Was it worth it? Olala!

6;Outstanding!;5.0;First of three Michelin one star restaurants we had the pleasure of dining in while in France. And this one was by far the best. Although both food and service is exceptional at these Michelin restaurants. Pur was a step above both with the service and the food. The staff was incredibly well informed able to answer all the questions about the dishes and never missing a beat. Although, we started with a bit of an issue regarding the typical requirement that in order to have the degustation menu, we both must have it. And that doesn't work since my girlfriend does not eat meat. However, they were accommodating and allowed me to have the degustation on my own, while she ordered an appetizer and a main. Every dish we had blew our minds. She had what appeared to be a very expensive simple tomato dish, but it was the best ever. How they could make tomatoes taste so good is amazing. This place is expensive, but in the end you do get what you pay for as it is outstanding, and the food, the service and even the setting are exactly the reasons why I would love to go back.;sept-14;Pur' - Jean-François Rouquette
6;AMAZING!!!;5.0;My partner & I celebrated our 5yr Anniversary at Pur' and it was well worth it! I had contacted the restaurant & told them it was a special celebration & they gave us a lovely table in the center of the dining room. The service was top notch & the food was superb!!!We ordered the 8 course (w/o the wine pairing) for 175 euros. 2 vodka martinis were 56 euros & 2 glasses of champagne were 58 euros. It was a very pricey dinner but the experience was definitely worth the expense. I would highly recommend this AMAZING restaurant experience & would definitely go again on my next trip to Paris!;nov-14;Pur' - Jean-François Rouquette
6;Among the best restaurants!;5.0;"I enjoyed dinner in Pur' with my girlfriend on Sunday evening 4.10.2014. I am somewhat of a foodie and have enjoyed dinners in a wide selection of Michelin starred restaurants. Our expectations for Pur' were obviously high, and as almost always we chose the degustation menu with the recommended wines.I am usually VERY critical when it comes to food, but this time I can only take my hat off and bow in humble admiration. The food was beyond good - it was phenomenal. Every single course was excellent, with the ""DRY AGED BEEF,BURNT EGGPLANT, SPRING ONIONS & SOUFFLÉED POTATOES"" taking me completely by surprise. It was simply put the best meat dish I have eaten in my entire life, and this coming from someone who has had dinners in tens of star restaurants. The wine pairings were spot on. Perhaps the only minor critique is that the last chocolate dessert was a bit too heavy on chocolate, but this is more of a personal preference than anything else... and having said that, I must confess that I did eat every last drop of it anyway and would've gladly had more.The service is very professional and friendly, with the entire staff making us feel welcome and valued.I would not be surprised to see two Michelin stars awarded to this restaurant soon. Highly recommended!";oct-14;Pur' - Jean-François Rouquette
6;Best birthday party ever;5.0;It was made possible by the excellent food and good service at Pur. We were 6 at the chef's table and it was really great fun and the food was excellent. The wine was superb. And service was attentive but not too much. It was the best birthday meal I've had ever!!;sept-14;Pur' - Jean-François Rouquette
6;The Best;5.0;Celebrating our anniversary.....EVERYTHING was EXCELLENT!! We ordered from a set menu so we didn't have to decide what to have. Wine pairing with it also.;oct-13;Pur' - Jean-François Rouquette
6;Great restaurant;5.0;Went here on Friday whilst staying at the Park Hyatt. Service was exemplary, food was fantastic. Staff explained everything that we were about to eat, & as my partner is pregnant, she couldn't eat any foie gras or the blue cheese, so they changed these courses for her (we had the 6 course taster). The little treats that came in between courses bump this up to about a 10 course meal altogether. The wine pairing with the food was spot on too.We rolled out of there very satisfied and glad we only had to go upstairs to bed! Well worth a visit!;sept-14;Pur' - Jean-François Rouquette
6;couldnt resist;5.0;the hotel is not far from vendome sq,very nice shops acroos for shopping and not to far from the hotel we stayed in the louvre,very central and very nice buildings atrue marvel;oct-13;Pur' - Jean-François Rouquette
6;A top restaurant;5.0;One of the best in Paris, I think. The hotel, modern and luxurious, is an attraction itself. The restaurant has excellent food and service. Note the exposed kitchen which you can see to the left of the entrance. What is so good are the small dishes they serve in between each course. Don't forget that after the dessert, there are still some goodies to come!;déc-13;Pur' - Jean-François Rouquette
6;Possibly the best meal I've eaten;5.0;Can not say enough about Le Pur!The menu was imaginative and very well thought out, the wine pairing was spot on each time, and the service was perfect.But the food here is the true attraction, as it should be! The flavours work beautifully in what was sometimes surprising pairings. Everything was cooked to perfection and the presentation was a work of art.I would recommend highly to anyone looking for a fine dining experience in Paris, and if our experience is anything to go by, would expect to see a second star added soon.;juil-14;Pur' - Jean-François Rouquette
6;Thought I'd had the best, but this was better;5.0;From the minute we were greeted by Eliza at the entrance, to my perfect martini, and to the lovely staff in the restaurant, this was one of the best meals of my life, and a perfect end to a quick break in Paris. The room was lovely and intimate, the degustation seemed to go on forever, and we were looked after like princesses. Open on a Sunday, I'll be back.;juin-14;Pur' - Jean-François Rouquette
6;Worth a visit but not life changing;4.0;I think Michelin got it right when they awarded Pur 1 star because while the place was beautifully decorated and the staff was attentive-nothing out of our 6 course meal stands out to me a month after our visit. In fact, my favorite part of the meal was the duck foie gras lollypop, which was served as part of the amuse bouche. Don't get me wrong-the food was good, but we only had one free night in Paris and I wish we had been able to people watch at an outdoor brasserie rather than be cooped up indoors at this bourgey establishment.;mai-14;Pur' - Jean-François Rouquette
6;Top 3 restaurants ever been to :);5.0;We have been there for my boyfriend′s birthday. Definitely one of the most delicious restaurants ever been to!Service was great,staff very friendly,food was amazing,we had a great time and will definitely go back if we visit Paris again :)!Totally recommend it to fine dinning and Michelin restaurants lovers :);juin-14;Pur' - Jean-François Rouquette
6;Excellent Dinner for a special occasion;5.0;From the mise-en-bouche to the turbot, the lamb and the wines accompanying the meal, everything was perfect. The staff is professional and friendly at the same time.The only minor default we found is that the delicious foie gras lolly pop they offered at the beginning of the meal were the same as a couple of years ago. They are still original and delicious so it is only a minor default.The room lightning and atmosphere is nice and cosy.;juin-14;Pur' - Jean-François Rouquette
6;Not the pinnacle of excellence, but quite an experience!;4.0;Pur served us a delicious, multi-course extravaganza featuring traditional and modern cuisine amid a lovely, modern, if somewhat nondescript, room. The waitstaff was personable and attentive, though at times the pace felt a bit rushed as we made our way through our six-course tasting menu with paired wines (and at least three or four additional small plates). Pur is a wonderful restaurant. Does the overall food and wine experience match institutions of gastronomic perfection such as Taillevent? No. But Pur is not (quite) at the same price point (but it is close). Pur is nonetheless a restaurant of wonderful quality, but you pay for it. For those value conscious, I would suggest either going for the gusto at a three-star gastronomic tour de force, or stepping down a rung. Four stars.;juin-14;Pur' - Jean-François Rouquette
6;A very good business dinner;4.0;I went with three other colleagues for a top notch dinner. The atmosphere in the restaurant is very nice and international. The selection of different tasting menus and A la Carte was very good. The service was fast and observant. The wine list was also very good 7,5 out of 10.;mai-14;Pur' - Jean-François Rouquette
6;Good but expensive;4.0;The staff is great and plentiful. The food was good but not the best meal we have ever had. Everything in Paris is expensive but this is off the chart.;mai-14;Pur' - Jean-François Rouquette
6;Pur' Park is fantastic!;5.0;Definitely deserving of the Michelin Star! We had the six course meal and it was amazing! I think I could have gone for the eight-course meal, but it would have been too much for my girlfriend. It is a remarkable experience from beginning to end. Get there early so you can enjoy a drink in the bar - they are remarkable! A three-week vacation in Europe in this was easily our best meal. It is on the pricey side, so forewarned of that, but well worth it if you are a foodie!;avr-14;Pur' - Jean-François Rouquette
6;Excellent and very memorable;5.0;Le Pur was excellent and worthy of its Michelin star. We had the 8-courses degustation with wine pairing, and most were hits, including the amuse. It was a lot of food, and perhaps the 6-courses would have been better. Stand-outs were the panna cotta of asparagus, the tofu in dashi, the abalone, and the lamb. The turbot was also excellent. The dessert courses were very good, but we were quite full by that time. Actually, the only course that was below par was the kobe beef that the kitchen comped because one of they had to redo one of the turbot dishes. The wine pairing was good, with some interesting choices. Although there were lapses, the service was excellent and we enjoyed the dinner.;mars-14;Pur' - Jean-François Rouquette
6;Degustation with friends;5.0;Enjoyed this immensely. We had the degustation with wines. The food was some of the best I've had anywhere in the world. Each course had wonderful presentation and tasted divine. Six courses as well as amuse bouche, bread, pre-dessert and petite fours was filling but not uncomfortably so. They also readily catered for our various dietary requirements. Wines matched perfectly and were decent serving size. Service was excellent. Attentive, professional and happy to speak in English, but they also made us feel quite comfortable. Good banter and wonderful attention to detail. Decor was elegant and comfortable, however could have used a splash of colour. Cutlery was unique. Kitchen could be seen, which I usually hate, but here it did not seem invasive in any way.Fairly expensive but no more so than other fine dining experiences. Definitely worth it. I found the whole experience wonderful and would happily dine here again.;avr-14;Pur' - Jean-François Rouquette
6;Fantastic attention to detail;5.0;Fantastic food and wine served by knowledgeable staff. Particularly impressed by apparently effortless link between kitchen and front of house. The girls were fantastic!;avr-14;Pur' - Jean-François Rouquette
6;Nice Lunch location;5.0;Nice location to have lunch or a drink. The Mango juice is probably the best I ever had. The staff is very friendly and attentive.;mars-14;Pur' - Jean-François Rouquette
6;Disaster;1.0;"Booked through The Fork. I printed the confirmation email and brought it with me. The hostess and someone else (presumably a manager?) said they didn't have our reservation despite me showing them the email both in print and on my phone. I don't care if it was their fault or the Fork's. There was literally no apology, no offer to seat us elsewhere or to take us later. In fact, it was much more of a ""good luck, see ya"" kind of vibe. This whole experience was infuriating, especially given that this was on a) a Thursday and b) the night before Valentine's Day in Paris. Finding a substitute was impossible -- all the best places were obviously booked. I wouldn't even consider recommending this place or returning at any point.";févr-14;Pur' - Jean-François Rouquette
6;Great atmosphere and food;5.0;This was the first Michelin restaurant we've eaten at in France so our expectations were high. It didn't fail to deliver.The main point was there was so much atmosphere in the restaurant compared to michelins in the UK.We chose the 8 course tasting menu with wine flight. All the courses were of an excellent standard, the staff were very helpful.Small touches like the the extra dishes between the courses and the gift at the end of the meal helped to make the whole experience memorable.;févr-14;Pur' - Jean-François Rouquette
6;Amazing;5.0;Amazing! Atmosphere, food, service. I can't wait to visit again. Well worth the price tag. Would recommend for all to try....;oct-13;Pur' - Jean-François Rouquette
6;Fantastic tasting menu;5.0;Liked all of it and the wine that went with each course complimented the food very well. Great service. Waiters and waitresses were very attentive but not too much so!;janv-14;Pur' - Jean-François Rouquette
6;Amazing experience!;5.0;A very nice restaurant, just what you might expect from a 1 star restaurant.I recommend the 8 dishes dinner which was great. However, i find that the sommelier was pouring us too much Champagne in each glass. besides that, the food was amazing and the service was very good.;janv-14;Pur' - Jean-François Rouquette
6;Close to perfection;5.0;Everything is done with taste. the decoration, the way you are received , the behavior of the waiters and of course the food and the wines are outstanding. Pricey.;déc-13;Pur' - Jean-François Rouquette
6;excellent experience;5.0;great dining experience if you can afford it.the 6-course dinner is lovely. french cuisine at its best.;mai-13;Pur' - Jean-François Rouquette
6;One star, not two;4.0;To be fair, we were there the week after New Years and the restaurant was almost empty. I found this made for a lack of conviviality. We had the degustation and I have nothing but good things to say about the dishes. Like many starred restaurants, they make the mistake of serving too many desserts, so that you leave feeling more full than necessary, but it is a minor complaint.More serious is the fact that the wines are truly overpriced, many at roughly 5 to 1 from the cave prices. I understand the economics of restaurants, but this seems excessive. Again, perhaps because the restaurant was almost empty there seemed to be several wait staff bustling about, which was disconcerting.The star is well deserved for the food. The rest needs some tweaking.;janv-14;Pur' - Jean-François Rouquette
6;Great memories!!!;5.0;"Le pur Park Hyatt Paris VendomeWe love this restaurant and once more we had a truly exceptional dining experience. Everything from the set the table, decoration and service to the food was perfect. Simply and delicious!! it's my favorite restaurant in Paris!!! Dinner at Patk Hyatt is the meal of a lifetime. And its true: a meal at Le Pur doesn't last a lifetime, but its memories do. The dishes will change each time we return and always we are astonished!! This time we had a small appetizers foie gras hot wine lollipops, , mille feuille Comte & viand grisson, White Truffle ravioli really amazing!! Jack-be-Little pumpkin with french crab with mandarine sherbet, ,scallops with algae butter and celery and riquette sauce,the ""Lievre a Royale"" with gratin macaroni- le plat des kings in French magnificent so delicious and unique the dish you need to try once in life and must be at Park Hyatt because they have the ""savoir faire"" that touches perfection!!I was humbled and very, very fortunate to have Jean Francois Rouquette himself and his sous chef Aie prepare our dishes!! Quite possibly, it is the highlight of every single dining out experience I've ever had. For the grand finale we had an desert with mango delicate and delicious and a second dessert with Rose ice cream and raspberry Charlotte with champagne cream.,,, the all experience remains the same: food as art. Love it!!!";déc-13;Pur' - Jean-François Rouquette
6;Fantastic dinner experience;5.0;My husband invited me to Pur' to celebrate our first anniversary :) The whole experience was delightful from start to finish. We went for the 6-course dinner, which is very generous if you also count the beautiful amuse-bouche sent by the chef (we started with a foie gras lollipop which was divine!!). The bread and wine selection are exquisite, (a wine is associated with every dish), the service is outstanding and the food is mouthwatering. Every course was a beautiful surprise for our palates, and, for the cherry on the top, we met the chef before leaving and he gave us little cookies to take home and eat the next day. I will definitely be back on my next visit to Paris!;nov-13;Pur' - Jean-François Rouquette
6;One of the best table in Paris!;5.0;1 star restaurant worthed at least 1 more, Everyhting is perfect , service , meal . the menu for 115 Euros for 6 course is more than enough because you end up eating like 10 with the little other amuse bouche. The only bad thing is that if you take a glass of champagne plus wine (even a regular one) plus water and coffee , you end up paying double the price ( we pay 404 Euros for 2 ) and only had a 1/2 bottle of bourgogne.;oct-13;Pur' - Jean-François Rouquette
6;What a wondeful restaurant;5.0;Have a coctail in the bar before dinner. They are just wonderful. Then sit down and enjoy the most wonderful dishes you can imagine;oct-13;Pur' - Jean-François Rouquette
6;Amazing and Memorable Dinner;5.0;I booked this restaurant for my husband and I's first anniversary, and we wanted to experience some of Paris' epicurean delights. This restaurant did not disappoint! We were waited on so well, that it was difficult for my husband and I found it difficult to hold a conversation, haha. We were surprised by how steep the bill was at the end of the meal, especially because we had not done wine pairings because I am pregnant. All in all it was worth it in the end, and would highly recommend to anyone!;sept-13;Pur' - Jean-François Rouquette
6;Good, but overpriced;4.0;We enjoyed our meal at Pur but it didn't quite meet our expectations given the steep price - 270 euros per person for the 8 course tasting menu paired with wines.The foie gras lollipop was a delicious way to start the evening - neither of us are foie gras fans, but this was our favourite! We also thought the lamb was amazing.They certainly try very hard to provide top notch service, but at times it fell below the mark. For example, we felt rushed as they would pour the next glass of wine before we had finished the glass we were already drinking.Next time, I'll try one of Paris' other excellent restaurants.;sept-13;Pur' - Jean-François Rouquette
6;A phenomenal meal in a fantastic setting;5.0;The tasting menu at Pur is an incredible experience, especially with the wine pairings from the expert sommelier (so nice to see a young woman in that role, and she clearly deserves it). From the foie gras lollipop amuse-bouche to the trio of desserts at the end, the meal was an exercise in incredible, intense flavours, immaculate presentation and impeccable service. It's well worth the price.;sept-13;Pur' - Jean-François Rouquette
6;Fantastic Culinary Experience;5.0;I recently celebrated my wedding anniversary at this great hotel restaurant located in one of the poshest areas of Paris. The food was fantastic but what really stood out was the quality of the service. From the sommelier to the servers, the staff makes sure that you have the best culinary experience possible. Highly recommended.;sept-13;Pur' - Jean-François Rouquette
6;Unforgettable;5.0;Go for the 7-course (as well as four amuse bouche servings including a foie gras 'lollipop!) tasting menu expertly paired with wines by their sommelier - we got an amazing education from her. Each course was 'wow' factor, truly memorable. If you are a foodie, treat yourself to this experience. Chef Roquette is a master and runs a brilliant brigade.;sept-13;Pur' - Jean-François Rouquette
6;This is truly six star dining;5.0;We had an amazing dinner.

6;An Epicurian Delight!;5.0;I had the 6 course meal with the wine pairing. Each course was an indulgent experience, with the Foie gras lollipop served first easing you into the meal!

It is a pure delight...

6;Wow!;5.0;This is a meal I will not soon forget! We had the 6 course meal, and I had the wine pairings as well.

6;"""Pur"" excellence";5.0;"The first general impression is the very quiet atmosphere of the Hyatt hotel lobby, a very charming, peacefull ambience when you just arrive from the chaotic traffic of Paris... We arrived a bit early, then we were invited to wait at the Hotel lounge, I recommend to go outside, there is a nice outside courtyard, we had a nice apperitif...The Pur restaurant was a great experience, we selected the 6 courses menu, I would recommend it, the 8 courses looks a bit too much, but that's only my opinion. We also selected the wine recommendation proposed in the menu.... There was a nice course after course experience and tasting... The service was perfect and very professional. We felt that it was going a bit too fast, we informed them and they adjusted. The kitchen is opened, you can see and feel the activity of the team, without disturbing the cosy atmosphere. The ""Sommelier"" was very professional, explaining in detail each wine and the relation with the meal.I really recommend the ""Pur"" , a nice gourmet experience in paris.";juil-13;Pur' - Jean-François Rouquette

6;Fantastic.. if money is no object;5.0;The food and service were both superb and I cannot criticise the craft of the chef and the attention of the staff.

6;A good way to ruin all your meals for the rest of your life;5.0;Food will never be the same once you've had a taste of something so pure from Pur'. All the other reviewers are spot on about the flavors and presentation of their food. Just magnificent! I won't go into specifics since a lot of reviewers did justice with the details of their meals, so I'll just mention a few things that come to mind when I recall our dinner a few months ago in September.-Made an online reservation that the hostess could not find. Had to show her my phone and confirmation before we were given a table. Kind of a pain, but warranted since it seems like we took the only table left in the restaurant. MAKE RESERVATIONS IN ADVANCE!-Really professional staff. There's a water-waiter, wine-waiter, restroom-escorter, napkin-replacer, and a couple of other positions of which I'm sure have official names. You pretty much get waited on hand and foot. Even the Server has his own assistants since his job is ONLY to take your order and announce your meal. Every person's food is presented at the same time by an individual server, and was brought out by the food-carrier who's only job is to carry the food. It's quite a show when your food comes out by a force of four servers. Did I mention it was only my husband and I?-Women's menu don't have prices. Standard of French dining, I suppose.-Dinner takes more than 3 hours. Close to 4. But so fun and worth it!-Pre-fixe menu is required by entire table if one person wants it. EVERYONE should want it!-Dress to impress!My husband walked out with a bill shy of $500 US dollars but it was definitely an experience we won't forget. That included aperitifs, bottle of wine, pre-fixe menu (about 8 courses?), dessert, and a memorable night.Totally worth it!;sept-12;Pur' - Jean-François Rouquette
6;Perfect Dinner @ Pur';5.0;I live in Paris and I oftenly go to the Park Hyatt Vendôme for a tea break or a drink at night, as I find this hotel is probably one of the most pleasant place I know in Paris, a true haven of peace.I finally had the opportunity to have a dinner at Pur', the Michelin-starred restarant, run by Jean-François Rouquette.As I'm not an expert into gastronomic review, I won't try to write an exhaustive review of every dish.All I can say is everything was perfect for this dinner :- the food itself of course, which was excellent from the very first hors d'oeuvre until the end. - Quantity for each dish were nicely dosed, which is very important for a 7-course menu- Service, highly professionnal and attentive and still friendly- Setting : the rotunda gives space and intimacy to each table, which is perfect for a romantic dinner- Atmosphere and lighting, which I find extremely pleasant just like the whole hotelI definitely recommend this restaurant if you want to have a wonderful dinner for a special occasion.;sept-12;Pur' - Jean-François Rouquette
6;Getting pampered but not 100%;3.0;The staff at the restaurant Pur make sure you feel pampered throughout the evening. Service is at a high level, the restaurant looks very nice and has a good atmosphere. The open kitchen is a delight to look at. However, we were less satisfied with the food. Maybe this was due to the high expectations we had (Gault Millau), but not all dishes lived up to this. Also not in comparison with a Michelin star restaurant in our village which charges slightly less than restaurant Pur'. One dish had flavours which did not match, other dishes were a bit bland in taste, with the main dish and its predecessor being the absolute top of the menu (delightful!). The wine pairings were not succesful throughout the menu (although the wines in itself were good - excellent). With hindsight I would have ordered a nice bottle of wine. Paris in itself is probably overpriced, but I did not get a 400€ worth experience of the evening.;janv-13;Pur' - Jean-François Rouquette
6;Fantastic. One of the best in Paris;5.0;Loved it. Amazing Service and Food. From the time you walk in until you leave you are attended to in a way very few restaurants do.

6;Tremendous;5.0;Had dinner at the restaurant on property, Pur, and it was among the finest dining experiences we've ever had. We dined on a Sunday night and the staff was positively superb. The food was also to die for. We opted for the six-course with wine pairings and it was incredible. The attention to detail was phenomenal. Don't overlool this restaurant even though there are so many choices in Paris. Have a drink in the lounge before dinner. Service is perfect in there as well, and the ambiance is ideal. Then, enjoy a spectacular experience at PUR. We loved it and if was the best meal and experience we had in Paris;nov-12;Pur' - Jean-François Rouquette

6;same architect, same noisy cupola, disappointly bland though beautiful food, excellent service;3.0;"At our recent stay in the Park Hyatt Milan we were prompted to try the Park Hyatt Paris near Place Vendome, which was designed by the same architect. Though I have some reservations about the materials and style of the Park Hyatt Milan, I wanted to check out the Paris location. Indeed the ""look and feel"" of the entry and lobby areas is quite similar, as is the building itself, a building with interior courtyard covered by a glass cupola. The contemporary clean look, the shiny pretty marble floors, are marred by what in my opinion is some pretty disquieting 'art-work' and decor (see pictures of the spooky light fixtures and creepy (in my opinion, alright) paintings). I'm thinking, with all the universally loved and beautiful and creative and glee-giving art out there, how could they have made these choices? What message are they trying to convey to us? ""Watch out or the creepy light fixure men will descend upon you and scratch your eyes out?"" I dunno.To the restaurant. we were seated in the cupola area which happened to be packed at lunchtime. The entry to the kitchen is equipped with a long table upon which all that takes place can be viewed as reflections in surround mirrors on walls and ceiling, angled precisely for that purpose. We were offered a cocktail and when we expressed interest in a coupe of champagne, we were elegantly described the houses, vintage of choices, last but evidently not least was the hyatt labeled something or other famous-house made especially to celebrate the hotel's 10th anniversary. I asked, ""it isn't $3000 a glass is it? "" and was told, well it is more expensive than the other types but it isn't that much..."" We would ""laugh"" about that later when we got the bill and saw that over half the amount was attributable to the €45ish per glass of champagne orders! I had the raw scallops, beautifully presented, but taste-free, much to my increasing-with-each-bite dismay. There were the very tasty dried berry dotting the plate adding beautiful color, and the paper-thin sliced radish so thin it was translucent, and some other exotic plant which were the tastiest things on my plate. The St. Jacques were perhaps defrosted? Dunno. I forget what my husband had, and which I tasted too. I guess that sums that up. Delicious bread products, as always, the hand-finished patty of butter (not to my liking though).Great service, cool ambiance, but very loud as the cupola created an acoustic bubble.Happily I did not hear any sound from noisy printers like one hears in the Milan Park Hyatt.All in all, great atmosphere, great service, stick to the regular vintages of champagne unless you are on an expense account, and don't rely on the menu offerings to satisfy a need for very tasty cuisine. Oh, and did I mention the artwork? Have a look. Maybe some people will enjoy these pieces, which are probably even famous and were probably very costly too.

6;Excellent service, fun view on the open kitchen;5.0;Had a wonderful dinner at Pur last night with the 6 course tasting menu for 100 Euros and the service like the rest of Park hyatt Vendome had been excellent. Have stayed at the Park Hyatt several times over last few years and eaten at breakfast at L'Orchidees, champagne brunch at L'Orchidees, at the bar/near the seating area by the fireplace for tapas, and I think on the Terrace too but had not made it to PUR before. The favourite thing I had eaten at Park Hyatt Vendome before was a foie gras creme brulee on a japanese porcelin soup spoon on the brunch buffet I think. Yumm..Had tried to go to PUR before for dinner and they were fully booked when I tried the day of but I think it was a weekend (Fri/Sat) when I tried vs Tues night on Oct 9 this time. I got a reservation same evening of and a table facing the kitchen with one of the best view of the house, probably only 2nd to the chefs table :D It is the photo on the Pur website which if you see the Chefs table, part of the open kitchen and 1.5 tables, I had the full table on the photo and frontal view of the open kitchen.. Full foodie haven!!! Hotel’s head chef, Jean-François Rouquette and team had earned 1 Michelin star and I think it is well deserved.I choose the 6 course tasting menu for 100 Euro since the 9 course one for 160 euro sounded as if I would totally stuff myself to the gills. Also I love lamb and the saddle of lamb was only on the 6 course menu. Declined the wine pairing which is 176 Euro if you have it with the 6 course tasting menu since I drank a bit the day before and just flown in that morning and was a little tired and jetlegged. Only intended to have 1 glasses of wine, maybe 2 if I found something I really liked.not sure if the menu I had is here still..[url]http://paris-restaurant-pur.fr/d/hyattparis/media/Dner_ukap_02_10_20120c74bf.pdf[/url]Pur has an excellent wine list and you can droll over the wall of wine fridges on your way in.. Some absolutely beautiful wines there. Some prices were not cheap, like the the 1996 PETRUS for 3500 Euro cough or the 6500 Euro for the 1995 KRUG CLOS D’AMBONNAY cough cough, but there are affordible choices on the wine menu. http://paris-restaurant-pur.fr/d/hyattparis/media/Carte_des_vins_PUR_site_internet__16.03.12.pdfI was dining by myself so was first looking at the wine by the glass (15cl) and saw a glass of 2011 Chablis 1er cru from Vaillon for 24 Euros which is 89 Euro if you get the bottle. Chablis 1er cru was my favourite when I used to live and working in Paris many moons ago so ordered that. Nothing really grabbed me on the glass list to go with the lamb so started persuing the main part of wine list since there were some half bottles there too. Looked through the bottle selection and saw a 2008 Savigny-les-Beaune 1er Cru - Les Marconnets - Domaine de la Vougeraie that looked very interesting for 38 Euro for the half bottle 37.5 CL. The 2008 or 2009 bottle from the same vineyard is 90 Euros. I love Beaune and remember fondly of a wine festival I went to many moons before where for 20 francs entrance you tasted some fantastic wines including Gevrey Chambertin and Nuit St. George. I tend to prefer red wines these days so if I had seen this before I ordered the glass of Chablis 1er Cru, probably would have just gone with the half bottle of red. They opened the half bottle to let it breath.You get many surprise tasting samples / amuse bouches. First up this night was foie gras lollipop with a grape coating and nuts with 4 others on a plate. An aspic on a toothpick wrapped around something, a mini-slice of toasted brioche with a topping, a small slice of something I cannot remember and a cigarillo type lacy pastry with nut butter and what tasted like slices of almond? The foie gras lollipop was great but did not surpass what I remembered of the foie gras creme brulee on a japanese style porcelin spoon from a brunch buffet at L'Orchidees a few years ago. I like that cigarillo thing too..Then they came around with another amuse bounch of red snapper with red fruit and tomato and a smoked tomato coulis. The mix of flavours were excellent.The first course was duck foie gras poached in hibiscus juice with enoki and soba noodles. Tasty and I liked the foie gras but I realized I prefer my foie gras seared and the enoki was fine but the soba noodle did not do it for me.The 2nd course was chanterelle mushrooms (or girolle sp? from the french explaination they gave to the next table) bouton de culotte, sazelnut cruble, sweet and sour mulberries... This I liked but I always like mushrooms and the mulberries were tiny bits of flavour.. In France you can go pick mushrooms and take it to pharmacy to be identified before when i lived there.Third course was Anglerfish (Lotte) with sea scented emulsion and young leeks. Nice fish and the taste was more delicate and subtle but with the memories of the bold and more complex flavours from the red snapper amuse bouche, I preferred that since I loved the smoked tomato coulis with the red snapper.4th course was the stuffed saddle of lamb, browned eggplant & sweet onions with some white filling on the tiny layer of grilled onion and jus and I think pine nuts in the stuffing. The Savigny les Beaune 1er Cru went well with the lamb which are 2 slices probably about an inch thick each and size about same as the center from probably a 1lb rack of lamb. 5th course was comte, red onion and wine aspic which was probably the course I was not sure about. Comte I can take or leave and given the choice would have preferred brie de meaux. Wondered what was on the custom cheese cart on the 9 course menu which the table to my right was having.I was suprised when they came with a little cup of chocolate mousse with ice cream but apparently dessert is served with pre-dessert and post dessert.Nice touch.The last or dessert course was a shortbreas tart with figs from Mr Baud lightly tangy with passion fruit juice, ice cream with sweet clover. It was a a small rectangle of sable pate with slices of figs and a small fig wrapped in a passion fruit juice and another small fig wrapped with grape juice. Loved the figs and especially the one in passion fruit juice.Post dessert was 3 things plus some home made nouget which they bring in a large jar.. the small square of nouget was excellent. The 3 things was a small sheet of orange crystalized lacy patisserie style baked with nuts and flour and sugar. Couple of chocolate truffle dipped in dark chocolate served on top of what tasted /smelled like burnt or toasted chipped espresso. And the last was some white chocolate and nut domed cluster with some freezed dried berries (blueberries perhaps).The bill came to 162 Euros service and tax compris. Since the service was excellent throughout the night, attentive and more than happy to answer any question I had, I added more than 10% additional tip to round up. When you exit the restaurant, you are given a small bag of a nut brittle covered one side by dark chocolate as a gift. I really do not want to know the sugar count of that meal with the wonderful desserts lol.Overall a very enjoyable meal with superb service.Highly recommend to go for dinner there and try to get a table with full view of the kitchen if you are a foodie. The price is highish but inline considering the quality of the food you get (especially with all the extra) and Pur is a 1 star michelin restaurant. The courses are not huge but you have more than enough to eat with the 6 courses and 4 additional surprise courses or amuse bouche.The restaurant is open 8pm to 10pm every night but i got there just before 9pm and the meal took close to 3 hrs.;oct-12;Pur' - Jean-François Rouquette
6;Pleasant experience!;5.0;My French friends brought me to this retaurant when I was in Paris this June. We tried the 6-courses menu with selected wines pairred. Overall we enjoyed it a lot. Dishes perfectly executed.service attentive but not pretentious. very pleasant dining atmosphere. the most impressive part is the sommelier really did a wonderful job in wine pairing!!!;juin-12;Pur' - Jean-François Rouquette
6;Fabulous;5.0;Beautiful, quiet restaurant, with perfect service. We decided on the tasting menu with wine pairings. The food was excellent and portion sizes such that you don't leave the restaurant overly full, and wine pairings were perfect. (We had debated doing the wine pairings, but were glad we had, trying some excellent wines which we otherwise were unfamiliar with). Pairings highly recommended!;sept-12;Pur' - Jean-François Rouquette
6;Nice experience at Pur'Park Hyatt in Paris;4.0;Pur was a good experience. We started with a drink on the terrace, and got back inside for dinner. Service is very attentive. I give it 3,5 stars out of 5, as food is good but not great, I just had higher expectations. menu is 100 euros per person for a fixed multiple courses menu, or 176 euros with wine pairing. pairing was also interesting, but not great;juil-12;Pur' - Jean-François Rouquette
6;Relaxing elegant bar;5.0;After all the walking and hustle and bustle, this is the perfect place to end the day;juin-12;Pur' - Jean-François Rouquette
6;Sublime;5.0;"We went to Le Pur' a few nights ago and had one of the best dinners of our life. Everything was just perfect - from the lovely room, to the attentive staff and the wonderful sommelier, to the food... the food was just amazing. We took the 6-course degustation menu, with accompanying wine.The amuse-bouches were delightful - the surprise was a ""lollypop"" made of fois gras... then came one course after another, each one just amazing, wonderful and delicate flavours and beautiful presentation. The wine was just right for the food, thanks to the lovely sommelier (the best one was the dessert wine, which she kept pouring again and again..).Of course we also got pre- and post-desserts. Coffee was also wonderful. When we left they gave us alfahores from the chef. Nice touch!!!I read reviews about the high price at this restaurant. I have to say that tonight we had dinner at another place (""Maison Blanche"") which was just awful by any standard, and we paid more than in Le Pur'. So if you judge by value for money, this restaurant wins. It was truly a wonderful experience and we will definitely come back for more.";juin-12;Pur' - Jean-François Rouquette
6;Definitely a 5-star service;5.0;Food is great, we started with the lightly cooked Prawns and the Abalones. Prawns were the best I have had. We then proceeded to the Veal, which smells amazingly and tastes great. The desserts were also remarkable, Mango Garden, and Chocolate Tarte. The highlight of the experience is the service: they take care of all small details, including a mini-tasting of dessert wines. We had an amazing night and will go back next time we are in Paris.;mai-12;Pur' - Jean-François Rouquette

6;Pricey;4.0;Excellent food, exceptional service and perfectly relaxing surround, but ultimately, astronomically expensive. We've eaten much better for much less. Nevertheless, a worthwhile experience if you're looking to splurge. We went with the multi-course tasting and weren't disappointed.;juil-11;Pur' - Jean-François Rouquette
6;nice restaurant!;5.0;last saturday night I went dining at Pur restaurant with my girlfriend. I was a bit afraid because other tripadvisor reviews were not always that positive and other restaurants like 'les ambassadeurs' were fully booked, but decided to give it a try and was certainly not disappointed! location: ideally located 50 meters of the beautiful place vendome in the classy park hyatt hotel at rue de la paixinterior: very elegant interior in a sort of circle , there is an open kitchen as well and when you enter the restaurant there is a wall with all great wine vintages. also for the ladies they offer a small 'handbag seat' not new or that special but still a nice touch.staff: every waiter / waitress was very friendly , chatty and down to earth , so thumbs up!The waitress (a trainee I believe) who served our table the most was very nice , professional and always in for a small laugh.food: now the most important part of all! we took the 6 courses tasting menu with wine pairings and it was good! it was innovative and had a great balance between traditional dishes and the modern touch they gave it. the highlight of the meal was the pigeon, perfectly rosé cooked! it was a 6 course meal but there were some smaller complimentary dishes also. The wine matched the dishes but I think they could do a better job on it , as the wine was not that great. the champagne was great however ( we took the barons de Rotschild brut) The total length of the meal was 3 hours.verdict: while a bit pricy it was still excellent value (you are in Paris after all) and deserves its one star in the michelin guide!;mars-12;Pur' - Jean-François Rouquette
6;Unique restaurant!;5.0;"They have changed the decor last year, it was good already,but since I have been couples of time in this place for business diners, it always been fantastic, I love the Chef cooking style and so ""Pur"" and precise! not boring ans stuffy like the big names in paris that you have heard about! what to say about the service! just professional, they are very attentive, yet friendly and looking after you to make your experience so special! Thanks to the Pur teamHurry up before the second michelin stars ! I will be back soon...JPR";mars-12;Pur' - Jean-François Rouquette
6;Good food, Attentive service;4.0;"Dined here while staying at the hotel. Made reservation in advance through hotel concierge, very easy. Had the 5 course tasting menu with the recommended wines. Started with a glass of delicious champagne, Fresh crusty bread offered throughout meal. In addition to the 5 courses on the tasting menu, they also brought out a few other small items including an amuse bouche plate to start, an egg dish (""cooked over very low heat""), and a nice sorbet/ice cream disk with small madeleines served just before desert. Meal featured foise gras, a delicious fish dish (best dish of the meal) in a very flavorful broth, pigeon, a brie / whipped cream dish with truffles, and a nice desert course that included caramel, chocolate, and a crisp sugar spackle (I think that's what they called it). With 1 glass of champagne to start and a cappucino with desert, the tasting menu with 4 nicely paired glasses of wine, the total bill was around 200 euros. Very nice, relaxed 2 hour meal, in a very pleasant environment. Delicous food and friendly warm service. Wasn't too crazy about the pigeon dish, but everything else was very good.";févr-12;Pur' - Jean-François Rouquette
6;Excellent but expensive experience;2.0;The food is good, the atmosphere is very classy and the service excellent. The price of this experience is - compared to other places in Paris serving similar food with larger portion in the same type atmosphere - frankly OVER PRICED.;sept-11;Pur' - Jean-François Rouquette
6;Very chic and very tasty;5.0;We took the 5 course menu and it was delicious. They even made us add one more course from the carte. The wine choice could have been better as they gave us the same wine for different courses but the overall was very nice. I would definietly go there again.;janv-12;Pur' - Jean-François Rouquette
6;Lovely restaurant, nice dining experience;4.0;The atmosphere and layout of the restaurant is lovely, intimate and quite relaxed. Service was excellent from all staff. My first and main courses were great - first course was a delicious seafood veloute with an extremely generous garnish of white alba truffle, grilled wagyu beef main with tasty tapenades. Banana and passionfruit dessert was tasty but quite aggressive in acidity. After a late night visit to the Louvre, this was a spontaneous dining decision and quite worth it.;oct-11;Pur' - Jean-François Rouquette
6;Nothing to Write Home About, but a Nice Experience;4.0;Staying in the Park Hyatt Paris Vendome for ten days, we decided to dine in at Pur' one of our evenings rather than venturing out. We had the tasting menu accompanied by wine pairings:The portions were small, the food was good, the service was great and the wine was plentiful!The best part of the tasting menu is that we experienced dishes that we never would have ordered on our own with some wonderful surprises especially the Turnips, but decidedly not the Pigeon.... It was a nice French dining experience in a wonderful atmosphere, but for the price there certainly are superior experiences out there.;nov-11;Pur' - Jean-François Rouquette
6;Lovely food -small portions;4.0;If you like steakoverhanging your dinner plate then go elsewhere.The quality was excellent but i can see the hungry being unsated.You van have a table facing the open kitchen but probably would like the calm of one in the inner rotunda .Staff delightful.When i said i hated pigeon on the set menu they gave me lovely lamb instead!;mai-10;Pur' - Jean-François Rouquette
6;Excellent but ££££££;4.0;The food, service and design of this restaurant were wonderful and I truly have no complaints. HOWEVER - the price was astronomical and I have eaten in some top London restaurants. Be warned. This only has one Michelin star.;oct-08;Pur' - Jean-François Rouquette
7;Exquisite experience;5.0;"We visited the restaurant with a group of 7. Beforehand, we asked the chef to prepare a special ""signature dish"" menu, with only the recommended highlights.

7;Probably the best 3 stars restaurant in Paris;5.0;We live in Paris so we have had the chance to enjoy several lunchs and dinners at Epicure. Probably the best 3 stars restaurant in Paris : Eric Frechon's cuisine is just amazingly fine and delighhful, the environement is the one of an elegant Parisian palace, the service is always very profesisonnal and nice, in the summer, the terrasse offers such a nice place to enjoy your 3 stars menu.

7;Excellent, excellent, excellent restaurant worthy of its Michelin stars;5.0;We had dinner at the Epicure restaurant in the Bristol Hotel in February 2020. Their usual room was being worked on so service was had in what was the private theatre/ballrom of the historic building. It was a beautiful setting. The food was, needless to say, excellent and memorable. Service was attentive without being intrusive. We only had a couple of quibbles. We have found many of the dishes that we had in Paris to be somewhat oversalted, and there were a couple of dishes here that fell into that mold. The more interesting issue for me is service-related. It is obvious that the staff were trained to walk as quickly as possible in the room, perhaps to enhance the impression of prompt, speedy service. I found it coming across as frenetic, imparting a nervous energy to the setting, and distracting from the otherwise relaxing and calming atmosphere of the restaurant. A minor quibble, and nothing that would stop me from returning for another fantastic meal.;févr-20;Epicure
7;10 michelin stars;5.0;They take the dinning experience to another level, paying attention to every single aspect of your experience and making sure you enjoy every single moment at the restaurant.;déc-19;Epicure
7;Superb Michelin Experience;5.0;Since this is a three star Michelin restaurant, we were expecting stupendous food and service and ... we were not disappointed at all. I found the waiters extremely attentive and friendly, ensuring our glasses were constantly topped up and our plates were served elegantly. The food was brilliant, I loved the caviar with mashed potatoes, the prawn with mango salsa and the macaroni with foie gras. The deserts were super refreshing and creative. I never found chocolate and lemon foam presented in such a unique and tasty dish. The only slight let-down was the implementation of chicken in the last main course. I never usually expect a chef to use chicken as it can be extremely hard to create a unique texture or flavour from chicken breasts or legs. Although it wasn’t bad, it was average (not breathtaking at all). Overall the meal ended with some coffee and lovely macaroons with everyone on the table content and happy. I would definitely recommended going here for a special occasion or taking a loved one here.;févr-20;Epicure
7;The best meal I've ever eaten;5.0;We had the 20th anniversary set menu and every single bite of the meal was absolutely delectable. I was in awe of how everything could be so impressive! Truly an art form, the service was impeccable, the food was delicious and the setting was stunning. I doubt that any meal in the foreseeable future could top the experience I had at Epicure.;juin-19;Epicure
7;A very good restaurant experience;5.0;I find the service here to be extremely professional and positive with every guest whether French or not, and most of the clientele is French which is a perfect indicator of the level of the cuisine and service here. The deserts especially are very imaginatively conceived.;févr-20;Epicure
7;Incredible Meal and Service;5.0;This meal from start to finish was incredible. Every bite has so much flavor and texture and was all very different so nothing tasted similarly. We had the langostines and macaroni stuffed foie gras to start, then the lobster and scallops for main. All were excellent. In addition to the incredible food, the service was fantastic. The servers were very friendly and extremely helpful. Overall fantastic experience! My favorite restaurant that I’ve been to in Paris!;févr-20;Epicure
7;Good but pricy;4.0;We had a great expereience at epicure, good food, good service, good wine but was not the level of Michelin 3 * we experienced in other restaurant. For the price I personnaly don't think it is worth it, but we had a great evening!;janv-20;Epicure
7;Phenomenal;5.0;I came here last year to celebrate getting engaged, and will be returning this year to celebrate getting married. The best and most romantic meal of our lives. We’ll be returning every year for the rest of our lives, hopefully.;juil-19;Epicure
7;Best Meal of Our Lives;5.0;This was the last meal we had in Paris and we will never forget it. Where to start? Expectations were through the roof as I had spent hours researching a three star Michelin restaurant (huge bucket list item) and seen the positive comments. All are echoed thoroughly. We did the Tasting Menu- it was beyond words. Caviar, Langoustines, Macaroni with Fois Gras, Scallops, Chicken, amazing dessert. The sommelier gave us great recommendations and we loved it. The decor, service and ambience were so amazing. Special thank you to Clara who was amazing!;janv-20;Epicure
7;Pure Class;5.0;Just a the most memorable lunch. Beautiful restaurant ovelooking garden courtyard. Nice welcome and introduction to the waiters. No bad tables here. Lovely pre- dinner tasters. Every element of each dish was perefect. So much love, care and creativity on display. The deserts just blew us away. Wine list was a bit crazy choice wise so just put it all in the sommeliers hands and he didn't let us down. I think this is the best French restaurant we have ever been to.;janv-20;Epicure
7;An incredible experience!!;5.0;An incredible experience!! After 4 weeks in Paris enjoying so many beautiful restaurants this was by far our favourite. Excited to return!;janv-20;Epicure
7;Simply Epicurean;5.0;The room in red and gold sets the sumptuous atmosphere for the dinner. The dining room is truly grand. The service incredible - detailed, exact, at the same time traditional and friendly. I had the impression they knew what I wanted before I did. And then the food of course. I love traditional French food and Epicure takes that, transforms it and by using the very best ingredients and masterful preparation uplifts something that is already great into realms of the godly. The wine list is something to behold. I can just urge you, don't skimp here. Go for one of the exquisite wines (don't think about base things like the cost) and enjoy. There are not that many places where you have this choice of great vintages. The whole evening was divine, a quintessentially French experience of the grand and living tradition of cuisine and dining. A perfect dining experience.;mars-19;Epicure
7;Everything a Michelin 3 star should be;5.0;My expectations were high for a Michelin 3 star in Paris – even higher than they are for a Michelin 3 star in the U.S. I was not disappointed in the food, service, or ambiance – outstanding in every way. In addition, my bill was significantly less than I expected, perhaps helped by very affordable wine pairings recommended by the sommelier. (It still was not cheap!)My only disappointment was that I arrived on time for my 1:30pm reservation, the latest time a lunch could be booked on the website. was seated promptly. and then was told that I was too late to order off the menu & had to accept a set course. Of course, each dish was outstanding, but I wish I had known when I made the reservation that I could not order off the menu. When I return, I will book an earlier time & verify that I will not have a “prison meal.” (no choice);oct-19;Epicure

7;Huge expectations, some disappointments;3.0;I’ve never thought I’d write a review like this for this restaurant, but ...Service was friendly and polite, but a little slow (restaurant was not crowded).Amuse bouches were more “visual” than tasty. Then, the stuffed macaroni - my biggest expectation - disappointed: very beautifully presented, but slightly dry and bland in flavour, I couldn’t feel the power of the truffles. For main course, I had the venison, which was not so tender and, again, nothing special in terms of flavour.As dessert, rice pudding with white truffles (just few slices for more than 100 euros), an interesting combination, perhaps the best part of the meal.Nice champagne and wines by glass.Cheese course with few options and tough macarons at the end.I admire Frechon as a chef, but, considering the fame of the restaurant, its 3 Michelin stars and huge prices, I expected more!;nov-19;Epicure
7;Haute cuisine without pretension;5.0;"We were celebrating my husband's birthday, and treated ourselves to four hours of the most glorious food and service we've ever experienced. Given the 3-star Michelin rating, one might assume that the service would be pretentious or a bit stuffy. Nothing could be further from the truth. We were welcomed with smiles, and all of the service staff happily shifted between speaking French and English as my ability allowed. We laughed and joked with the staff during the night, engaging them in conversation, and everyone of them were charming and gracious. I had forgotten the almost ""ballet-like"" feel of service at this level. The 20th anniversary tasting menu was a revelation, as was the wine that our sommelier helped us select. The food exceeded expectations, both in taste and presentation. This is artistry at its finest, and the pacing of the meal allowed us to take in everything: the food, the wine, the room itself, and each other. At the end of the meal, they called a taxi for us, and we waited at our table until it had arrived. On the way out, they presented us with two loaves of freshly baked bread in beautiful cloth sacks. It's not an inexpensive venture, but if you make the decision to go, go ""all in"" and enjoy it. For most of us, this is a rare treat, and Epicure served up memories that will last a lifetime.

7;3 star excellency;5.0;We had a very nice time in this restaurant. Of course the staff is friendly cause of the 3 stars, but even so it felt as a genuinely warm welcome. We had the menu with a glass of Champaign (rosé) and a small bottle of Pomerol (red wine) to accompany the courses. All courses were exquisite.The bill was as expected, but not as high as a 3 star restaurant in Belgium.Definitely would come back on our next visit.;déc-19;Epicure
7;Seamless & flawless experience;5.0;We’ve been visiting Le Bristol Paris periodically over the last eight years. Every experience being unforgettable and magical. From exquisite afternoon teas at le Café Antonia, to birthday meals at le 114 Faubourg to cocktails at their bar. We celebrated our engagement at Epicure back in 2011. It goes without saying that the Michelin starred restaurant holds a special place in our hearts. We lunched at Epicure yesterday for a celebratory meal to commemorate our imminent expatriation to India. The experience, from the porters’ greetings to the retrieval of our coats at the very end, was flawless. My husband and I both chose Eric Frechon’s 20th anniversary menu. An eight course dining experience that allows you to savor every signature dish of the Chef Frechon. We were blown away by every single bite we took. The precision of the flavours, the impeccable dish presentation, the amazing champagne pairings. A solid favourite of ours was the sea scallop in watercress juice served with gnocchi and black truffle. An absolute treat for the taste buds. A special mention to the decadent stuffed macaroni with truffle, artichoke and foie gras. Epicure wouldn’t be the well-oiled machine it is without its excellently skilled and attentive front-of -house staff. Mehdi was the very charismatic and charming Chef de rang who took care of us. He was friendly, efficient and professional. He was present yet not overbearing. We were incredibly fortunate to get a guided tour of the kitchen, the chocolaterie and the brand new mill. We were kindly gifted two loaves of bread and a few viennoiseries that we had for breakfast this morning. Eric Fréchon and his team continue to surprise and marvel us with their culinary prowesses and immaculate service. Thank you to the Bristol team! We will be back in June.;déc-19;Epicure
7;Among Our Best Ever in Paris;5.0;It had been 8 years since we dined at the Bristol, back in the days of the Oak Room. So we looked forward to trying the Epicure and were not disappointed. The décor of the room, the service and the delicious food were all wonderful. Food presentation was clearly 3-star, with one exception—the freshly baked bread. A whole loaf, a bit over-baked, left an extreme mess of crumbs each time we broke off a piece. But overall that did not take away from a delightful evening. Wine service was a stand out. You expect to leave feeling treated to the best, and we did!;déc-19;Epicure
7;Wow;5.0;Entering epicure at the hotel Bristol As if you entered another realm another world where you stay in this dream until your meal ends .. service ambiance and food are out of this world.. we had the 20 years anniversary tasting menu with wine pairing, also it was my fiancées birthday and the staff were more than helpful in planning my surprise to her .. price is high, but you are dining in one of the best restaurants in the world ..;déc-19;Epicure
7;À délice!;5.0;In a nutshell, « A delicious moment for the taste buds » If you have a chance to visit this restaurant, I suggest you don’t miss it. Food - Perfect one can taste the time that the chefs have put into their art. Cleanliness - Very clean and one can only admire the decor. Value - Worth every penny personally I was expecting to pay more. Service - Well, this is the tricky part... as much as I love everything else about this restaurant, I think the staff can do better, if I was to put a word to describe them it would be « hautain »;déc-19;Epicure
7;Michelin Star Bias;4.0;On Sunday night we had dinner at Epicure, the Michelin 3 star restaurant at the Le Bristol Hotel. I ordered the langoustine appetizer and the venison main course.Epicure has been receiving 3 Michelin stars for years- but why? On Monday night, we had dinner at Taillevent. Taillevent was stripped of its 3 Michelin stars years ago and now it is barely holding on to just one star.But the difference between Epicure and Taillevent is beyond the pale. Epicure's service relies on millenials whose mission seems to be to get you in and out in a flash instead of the expected leisurely pace one expects in a 3 star restaurant. Taillevent instead offered a polished, well-trained and mature staff who average their training and experience in decades instead of Epicure's months. At Taillevent every course was well-paced, attentive and leisurely but not overly extended and you get to fully relax.And the food quality- Epicure was good but Taillevent was exceptional and we are comparing apples to apples, as I had the exact same choices.At Epicure, our 50 minute meal came to an abrupt end with the check. We had to remind them of the dessert norm of macarons and chocolates. So, for approximately 250 Euros per person at Epicure, you get a one star experience versus the three star delight of Taillevent.I come to Paris 3-4 times per year and find the best restaurants to enjoy. So, I can be highly objective.This year the complaints by French chefs regarding the Michelin ratings have been substantial. My personal experience as a customer mirrors their outrage.;déc-19;Epicure

7;Impeccable Service, spectacular food!;5.0;Our October visit to Epicure for a 50th birthday celebration was phenomenal. My husband is an executive chef and we decided we wanted to sample many dishes and get the full 5 star experience. Once seated with white glove excellence, we opted for the Chef’s menu and we not disappointed. Our 8 course meal began with freshly baked bread, caviar over seasoned mashed potatoes and moved through the meal with langoustines, pasta, scallops with truffles, duck breast cooked in quite a special way (leave this one for a surprise) and culminating with three courses of dessert. The entire time we were served an tended to as if we were the only ones there. The maître d’ was exceptional and allowed us communication with the restaurants amazing chef, as well as special attention to our needs and reason for celebrating. Epicure is not for the patron who does not want to pay for a five star experience, but for those who want to eat and be treated in quite a royal way....Next visit to Paris, especially for the “wow” factor. Take an evening with someone special and enjoy Epicure.;oct-19;Epicure
7;Wonderful 3 Michelin star lunch;5.0;Each time we stop by Paris during our annual holidays, we will dine at one of the Michelin star restaurants. This trip was a visit to Epicure.Excellent restaurant with good food and great service. Dining room was cosy and bright. We had lunch and chose one of the set meals and thoroughly enjoyed our meal.Housed inside the Le Bristol Hotel, the hotel has a wonderful classy ambiance and adds to the visit during our lunch.;oct-19;Epicure
7;Perfect Dinner;5.0;We dined at Epicure on the last night of a brief, but gastronomy rich, visit to Paris. The Epicure was a fitting perfect end. The food was innovative and amazing. The service was charming, expert, and friendly. It’s reputation is well deserved!;oct-19;Epicure

7;5 stars;5.0;Amazing restaurant in Paris. Everything is super and perfect. The ambiance and the decor here are unique, the service is fantastic, the Food is superb! Great food experience.;oct-19;Epicure
7;Amazing Experience;5.0;My visit to Paris this time around was focused on French gastronomy adventures. I did extensive research and knew I wanted to eat at a three star Michelin restaurant. Contacted the restaurant and there was a table available for lunch for one person. I secured a reservation at the world's second best restaurant. I was so thrilled. As soon as I walked into the restaurant I was immediately greeted and welcomed. They took my coat and I went downstairs to the washroom to wash my hands before I sat down. They escorted me to my table and I sat on the red couch facing outside. I had the best seat because I could observe and take in the experience and view everything. They asked if I wanted a book because I was dining solo. I said no thank you as I wanted to observe and look around. They made me feel comfortable and never awkward. I did the chef's anniversary tasting menu. It was so worth it! From the amuse bouche, to the bread, to the entrees, and desserts - everything was impeccable! The staff was so orchestrated I loved watching them. My wait time between courses we never long. They really took care of me. My water was always filled and they would always come and check on me and make small talk. My overall experience was very professional and orchestrated. The food was to die for. This is by far the best meal of my life. I am glad I did the anniversary tasting menu and it definitely lived up to the hype. I hope to be back. Thank you Chef and thank you to the staff for welcoming me and allowing me to be a guest at Epicure. What an honour. Merci!;nov-19;Epicure
7;Atmosphere Top Notch;5.0;Everything about this venue conveys elegance and comfort. The team functions as a greatly tuned choreography moment. Even water glasses are filled promptly constantly. We only had mains and dessert, but the amuse bouche were a delight. The lamb was delectable.;oct-19;Epicure
7;Inoubliable;5.0;Epicure features among the high temples of three star gastronomy. and there can only be a handful of restaurants in its league. Our dinner dinner was among the three or four most memorable meals of our life. The 20th anniversary menu proposed by Eric Fréchon features most of the 'classics' and signature dishes of Epicure over the years, including the famous macaroni stuffed with truffles, and foie gras with a gratin of old parmesan, the pommes de de terre fumées au haddock with caviar, the charred leeks filled with clams etc., and the Bresse chicken in pig's bladder..... It was all impeccable, and service attentive without being too formal. The wine list is vast and prices are steep, especially for wines by the glass and juices by the glass. But the quality of ingredients is such that the price point is fully justified... our daughter, who at 11 has had ample experience with haute gastronomie, thought that dinner at Epicure was right up there with two other past dinners, also in three star venues.;oct-19;Epicure
7;I m surprised about the rating of this restaurant. One of my worse experiences;1.0;I dont think any other time will be better. It was early brunch, late breakfst for me. The place did smell bad, kind of mouldy. That alone would have been a reason for me to leave. But my company wanted to stay. I only ordered things, I know well. My carefull questions, refering to my strong garlic allergy was met with open hostile refusal to point out what to avoid. The breakfast bowl was a mess: Just mixed up things that should not be mixed. Dont mix onion with baked beans and egg, please. Banana fruit bread tasted of ONION. The green vegetables were dead, boiled to undefinable mash. And the smell of it, would turn a skunk into a run. Unbelievable experience. What happened to the historical famous French cuisine? But worse was the attention. I m rarely shouted at in a canteen, why tolerate it in a - self declared - upper upper class restaurant? Thats also why there are no pictures.;mai-19;Epicure
7;I enjoyed the best meal of my life here at Epicure. Everythiny else now is downhill...... !;5.0;I'm going to say that this is, by some great margin, the best meal that I have ever eaten. At Epicure, celebrated chef Eric Frechon holds three Michelin stars. To date, this was the first three star meal I have enjoyed. The difference in quality, approach, taste pairing shows the gulf between a good restaurant meal, a one star Michelin star establishment compared with Epiucre. This takes cooking to a totally different level of skill and enjoyment.I loved his famous macaroni stuffed with black truffle, artichoke and duck foie gras, gratinée with aged Parmesan, but all dishes were standout. I don't normally eat bread, but the handmade bread is made from flour grinded each day is superb and I could happily live off only eating the Roquefort and Camembert cheese course.The service is attentive, friendly and polished, the venue beautiful and compliments the food really well. This then redefines the phrase fine dining. The challenge now is that from this point on, very few restaurants and chefs will get close to this level of attainment and skill and most meals will seem to be an anti-climax.Its hard to get a table here, but well worth the wait for any foodie seeking the ultimate gastronomic experience.;sept-19;Epicure
7;Amazing!;5.0;The service, atmosphere and food were amazing. Most plates were delicious and beautiful. The mains we had (venison and veal) were a little lacking compared to the appetizers and dessert but in general a very memorable experience. Expect to spend roughly $400-500 per person here but is is well worth it. Also there is a relatively strict dress code, I suggest asking them what you may wear prior to arriving at the restaurant.;oct-19;Epicure
7;My favourite;5.0;I really like this restaurant, we eat very well, professional service with an excellent person, I love French cuisine, but what I prefer is their desserts, a real delight, it is expensive but excellent value for money;juil-19;Epicure
7;A Gastronomic Delight;5.0;My husband purchased a gift voucher for lunch for 2 as part of my 50th celebration and it was truly magnificent. From the moment we walked in, the staff attentiveness was exceptional and genuine. It is impossible to describe the extraordinary variety, the superb taste and wonderfully knowledgeable wine pairings. One of the many memorable moments of our meal, was when the maître de presented me with the most glorious bunch of roses for my birthday. The little touches made it such a great experience - thank you to Bonadventure, Mehdi, Hugo, Stephane, Thomas, Chloe and the Team! So do yourself a favour, book ahead and enjoy a meal par excellence!;oct-19;Epicure

7;Exceptional cuisine;5.0;My wife and I dined at Epicure last night. What a truly wonderful experience. The staff are all friendly and helpful. We were greeted at the door and warmly welcomed. The tasting menu is an absolute delight. Each dish is so special and the portions sizes are just right. The restaurant is elegant with a sophisticated ambience. This is a very special place that will will give many happy lasting memories.;sept-19;Epicure
7;Delicious;5.0;Worth the 3 stars. Great service and great food. We sat in the outside garden area which was beautiful.;sept-19;Epicure
7;Divine!!!;5.0;Let me begin by saying that this restaurant had a challenging task to get us through the 20th anniversary tasting menu in 1.5 hours so that we could get to the airport. The service was 10/10. Every person was incredibly knowledge about ingredients and preparation. The food was simply divine. I will have dreams about this meal forever. Highlights - foie gras appetizer. I don’t even like this dish typically. It was prepared in a sublime fashion. Absolutely wonderful with a delicate green froth. That doesn’t sound appetizing but I found myself repeatedly indulging when I usually find myself finding the taste too strong. The bread is made from flour they grind daily - only French restaurant to do this. The Normandy butter is worth taking home - it is so good. The entree highlights were the macaroni and Dover sole. We both almost licked the plates in full ecstasy. To top of the course - we had Roquefort and Camembert cheese. It melted on the palate and was so divine we stopped talking to just enjoy it. We ordered dessert but ran out of time. I have to tell you that many people took great care of our table and it was a fabulous service and meal. You can tell that this is their passion. Overwhelming friendly and quite conscious of our table needs - filling wine glasses and moving service along, etc. I hope you are lucky enough to get a table. Good lord it took moving mountain for us to get in and was worth it. It was a little quiet at the 7:30 hour but managed to fill up quickly. Merci! We shall be back!;sept-19;Epicure
7;25th Anniversary dinner;5.0;One of the best (maybe the best) fine dining experiences of our lives. The food and service were incredible. We are so happy we visited Epicure and we will never forget it.;sept-19;Epicure
7;It is still perfect;5.0;I go there at least once a year.Service is still perfect, cuisine is still perfect.Macaroni, poultry, fishes and sea food are still perpared in an innovative and palable way.For several years Quality had not been affected by the time passing by and changes in the staff.Congratulations and tank you for the wonderful times I spent with you.I recommend for wine choice to trust the sommelier who has always good tips to discover confidential products at reasonable price ... even if you are at Epicure, a 3*... but don’t dream it is costy :500 to 600€ per capita;sept-19;Epicure
7;Great;5.0;I was hve fun lunch in here and great service.. there's hve good food also and awesome tea from my side just keep and improve all.. and thanks you so much;sept-19;Epicure
7;Amazing;5.0;We went for lunch. It lasted four hours. The food was a gastonomic feast! The service was impeccable and the courtyard where we dined was beautiful. A bit noisy due to construction but the atmosphere and service made up for it.;août-19;Epicure
7;Unforgettable;5.0;Our visit to Epicure lived up to every expectation and then some. Every dish on the tasting menu was memorable from the caviar to the final dessert the food was awe inspiring. The service too, was impeccable. Every need was attended to without being overly fussy. Highlights were the stuffed macaroni, crab, the chicken cooked inside a pig bladder, and the lemon sorbet with white peach. Honestly, everything was a highlight and we can’t thank the staff enough for such a special evening.;août-19;Epicure
7;A wonderful birthday evebibg;5.0;As two couples, we dined at l’Epicure for my wife’s birthday. It was a perfect evening from the moment we arrived in the hotel. The receptionist greeted us warmly and showed us to the lively hotel bar for a pre-dinner cocktail. The dinner itself was extraordinary. Two of us ordered the anniversary tasting menu and two ordered à la carte. In some restaurants, this would not have been permitted or would have caused difficulty, but here it was no problem at all. The team timed the delivery of courses to perfection, so that we could all enjoy our meals together. The food was inventive, varied, beautifully presented and full of flavour. The evening was made especially joyful and memorable by the team who served us. They were gracious, professional and highly expert. More than this, they were engaging and good humoured. It was clear that there was an affinity among them. they were perfectly co-ordinated and they obviously enjoyed their collaboration. We are very grateful to Stephane and his team for treating us to such a wonderful dining experience.;sept-19;Epicure

7;Unforgettable service;5.0;The cuisine was very nice but what makes Épiqure so special was this so warming and special service you can get there. It makes your journey better, your life happier and your time spent there unforgettable.;août-19;Epicure
7;Amazing Meal;5.0;Epicure was by far our favorite of the Michelin star restaurants we ate at on our recent trip to Paris. The 20th anniversary tasting menu was amazing!! I can't think of one thing to criticize about Epicure. The caviar and mashed potatoes was a revelation ... my nine year-old daughter is still asking for those mashed potatoes as well as the chicken that was cooked in a cow bladder for 4 hours. The service was outstanding. Definitely a cut above the other 3 Michelin star venues we went to. My daughter was treated like a princess and they made her anything she wanted. At the end of the meal they bring out chocolate and macarons - definitely don't be shy on those - I only got one chocolate macaron and still regret not eating two - when we left they gave us a loaf of their delicious bread to take with us. They actually mill their own flour. I can't wait to go back.;août-19;Epicure
7;Fantastic!!;5.0;I’ve eaten at many excellent restaurants including those highly rated Michelin and this one is the icing on the cake! From the moment you step inside until the very end you are treated like royalty. The food is fantastic, service and attention to detail was impeccable and the Sommelier was first class. Very comfortable and enjoyable dining experience, truly a pleasure dining experience. If you in Paris and a foodie, this place is a must!!;août-19;Epicure
7;Awesome Celebration !;5.0;My husband and I had dinner there for our aniversary , dinner was spectacular , loved the caviar and the signature dishes , don’t forget to make it with pairing !.. they don’t have it as a mente but they surely recommend great wines .. also they have delicious champagne ! .. and the best of all .. the chocolates and macaroons .. omg .. something unforgettable .;août-19;Epicure

7;Well deserved three star michelin epicure;5.0;From start to finish, we were treated like royalty. The service was top notch and the food was even better! We chose the tasting menu and it was fantastic. The bresse hen in a bladder and the macaroni with black truffle were our favorite dishes. The dessert was also heavenly. The staff was amazing especially the maitre d! They even asked us to have any dish cooked for our four year old and they made him his spaghetti bolognese! It was our son’s fourth bday and they made a Mille feuille bday cake for him. And we didn’t even realize our son left his golden Mickey Mouse you at the restaurant until Emile emailed me the next day.We love epicure!;août-19;Epicure

7;Memorable meal, best wine pairing ever;5.0;My husband and I shared a memorable meal at Epicure. The food was outstanding, and the wine pairing was insanely perfect. The sommelier made incredible recommendations. The atmosphere was bright and airy, beautifully located in the Bristol. The meal, although formal, was not overly formal and was very comfortable. The service was the best, especially Hugo and Pauline. Hugo made some suggestions that really enhanced our meal. A memory we will cherish!;juil-19;Epicure
7;Fabulous;5.0;"It has taken a while for me to catch up on all my reviews. I did think after this length of time should in send a review.This restaurant is so good I felt I must. There is only one word to describe Epicure and that is ""fabulous "".

7;I can't put my finger on it entirely but more like a 2*;4.0;First of all my dining colleagues thought this was an experience worthy of a 3*. I think my main bug was the formality of the staff, I would of liked a more congenial atmosphere. The dining room is bright and airy. The Vilmart bubbles was a nice segway into the experience. Impressively they mill their own flour for the bread. I had globe artichoke for entree and chicken for main. Presentation worthy of a 3*. I most enjoyed my vanilla dessert. The Billaud Chablis was good but most impressive was the 2000 Cantermerle which was priced really well.;mai-19;Epicure
7;Fantastic experience;5.0;Michelin 3 star well deserved! Elegant, incredible service, wonderful menu and if the weather is good terrace dining. Like everything else at the Bristol - elegant in an understated way.;juin-19;Epicure

7;Incredible Lunch Experience;5.0;Went to Epicure for lunch, and it was an incredible food experience. I have had lunch/dinner at many Michelin star restaurants, but this was probably my favorite. The food is unique and creative. I tried there appetizers, which were all superb, with my favorite being the stuffed macaroni. The staff is extremely friendly and quite laid-back, which we did not expect. They were also very accommodating to our dietary requests, despite us not giving them an advanced notice. I also had one of the best desserts of my life at this restaurant, which really capped off the meal on an excellent note. Highly recommended!;juin-19;Epicure
7;A fantastic way to make a trip to Paris special!;5.0;This was first-ever dinner in a 3-star Michelin restaurant... and we were not disappointed.Starting with their on-line reservation system, planning was easy.The location was one block from our hotel - Hotel Splendide Royal (which was also marvelous).The service was impeccable, atmosphere was bright, and food was delicious.The staff was surprisingly young - all under 40, and most under 30. They were lighthearted, and full of suggestions.We had a 3-course, a-la-carte meal, with surprises from the kitchen in between courses. The food was tasty and wonderfully presented. The wine list is unbelievable, including a decent selection of wines by the glass (though only a limited selection of German whites).We were celebrating a wedding anniversary, and they did everything they could to make it special!;juin-19;Epicure
7;The apex of my entire life;5.0;Epicure offers a unique and memorable dining experience. The dining room and the surrounding gardens are stunning. The cuisine consists of just plain good ingredients prepared in unique ways that enhance the natural good taste. The service is performed like a Broadway play...with a flourish. In short, it’s well worth the price.;juin-19;Epicure
7;A spectacular evening!;5.0;"I spent many years in the French restaurant business in Philadelphia - five of this spent at Philadelphia's legendary Le Bec-Fin (Mobil 5 Star when such things had meaning). Not only is the food wonderful, but the staff joyously practices their craft. There is nothing ""stuffy"" here - just a truly wonderful (and probably ""once-in-a-lifetime) experience. This is a ""must"" for anyone seeking the height of fine dining in France.";juin-19;Epicure
7;Absolute perfection!!;5.0;The atmosphere and ambience are truly beautiful. The staff are very warm and inviting and have excellent people skills. We had a 7 o’clock reservation and diamond there for four hours enjoying their tasting menus. My wife and I ordered the poached chicken, it was the best chicken that I’ve tasted in my life!! This restaurant deserves a fourth Michelin star........If you come to Paris do not miss this restaurant!;mai-19;Epicure
7;On par with the 3*;4.0;When you go for lunch or dinner at a three star restaurant you expect a top quality setting and service in addition to over the top food. You’ll find all those elements at the Epicure, the flagship of Eric Frechin’s small collection of restaurants. We had lunch ion a sunny day in the fantastic inner garden which makes you feel at the countryside although you’re in the busy center of Paris. No complaints on the service. Food is worth the 3* although it’s not my favorite food in Paris. I’m lucky to have donned in all Parisian 3* and the Epicure in my view does not top the likes of Guy Savoy or Pierre Gagnaire. That’s just my opinion mind you. In any case you won’t be disappointed if you book a table at the Epicure !;juil-18;Epicure
7;It is still perfect;5.0;I go there at least once a year.Service is still perfect, cuisine is still perfect.Macaroni, poultry, fishes and sea food are still perpared in an innovative and palable way.For several years Quality had not been affected by the time passing by and changes in the staff.Congratulations and tank you for the wonderful times I spent with you.I recommend for wine choice to trust the sommelier who has always good tips to discover confidential products at reasonable price ... even if you are at Epicure, a 3*... so it is costy.;avr-19;Epicure
7;Perfect dinner!;5.0;I chose the Epicure to celebrate my 40th birthday and we had dinner with our 2 daughters of 5 and 7 years old. The food is for sure exquisite, but what really made the difference for me was the service. I was worried that my daughters (although quite) were too young but I did not feel once that they were an inconvenience for the restaurant. The personnel pampered them with painting activity, a doudou, personalized menu and little gift at the end. I was really grateful! Thank you Epicure for making my birthday such a special day. We will for sure visit again (adults only this time).;mai-19;Epicure
7;Epicure the restaurant is exquisite;4.0;The very first 3 Michelin star restaurant we tried in Paris. Given the time difference it’s usually quite a struggle for us to keep ourselves awake during dinner time but food is quite nice. I really love the oysters wrapped with leek as it’s very unique and tasty. The scallops or prawns are cooked nicely but the dishes themselves are quite common. I also really appreciate the fact that the restaurant arranged a little birthday surprise for us so thoughtfully and even sneaked in a rose to my bf so he can give it to me. Very romantic gesture and sometimes those little things do count and shows how the restaurant cares about their customer. Great service epicure!;mai-19;Epicure
7;Absolutely perfect;5.0;Enjoyed one of the best meals of our lives at this amazing restaurant. Top notch service, outstanding food quality, and a sophisticated (but not pretentious) atmosphere. Felt instantly at ease when we arrived, and our table had a lovely garden view. Staff sent us home with plenty of sweets and goodies. Overall, exemplary dining experience, highly recommend and would personally love to return one day!;mai-19;Epicure
7;Flawless;5.0;"I had the pleasure of dining at Epicure on May 1st. On my trip to France and Spain, I also ate at Ledoyen and Le Cinq in Paris and at ABaC in Barcelona, all being Michelin 3 star restaurants, and at Abantal in Seville (one Michelin star) and at Santceloni in Madrid (two Michelin stars). While the service at all of the restaurants was exceptional, the service at Epicure was absolutely flawless, and the servers were extraordinarily friendly and were as conversational as you wanted them to be. All were fluent in English. I ordered the stuffed macaroni (with black truffle and duck foie gras), the whiting fish (in a crust of bread with almonds), the Bresse Farm hen poached in a bladder and the ""cocoa beans"" dessert. While all of the courses, as well as the amuse bouches and the ""palate cleanser,"" were delicious, the stuffed macaroni and the hen served with a ""yellow wine"" sauce and crayfishes were absolutely amazing. Although the hen dish was listed on the menu as being for 2 persons, one of my servers (I believe that it was Mr. Segui) stated that it could be prepared for one person. I consider it special when a fine dining establishment can be accommodating in such a fashion, and there is no dining establishment finer than Epicure.";mai-19;Epicure
7;Impressive French cuisine;5.0;the restaurant staff are welcoming and helpful in explaining the menu. We tried the tasting menu and starts the 4 hour dinner until midnight. dishes are great in taste and presented well. four of us enjoyed the dinner very much and would definitely come again . The portion are huge so need to reserve an empty stomach for tasting menu!;avr-19;Epicure

7;Wonderful;5.0;Absolutely amazing experience. Very delicious meals and impeccable service makes this place excellent choice for a dinner;oct-18;Epicure
7;Brilliantly memorable;5.0;Everything is done to perfection, from the mouth-watering langoustines to the fraises ciflorette, via pigeon, lobster, sole, morels… until finally, the mignardises trolley suddenly appears. The service — Stéphane, Mehdi, and their colleagues — were amazing and played a huge part in the success of our evening.;mai-19;Epicure
7;Outstanding FOOD and SERVICE.;5.0;We had lunch and chose the 20 year anniversary tasting menu. In our three hour meal there was hardly a misstep. Some of the highlights: The roasted leek with oyster sauce, it looked great, it tasted great it is truly one of the greatest dishes in the culinary world. But there is more Chicken made in a bladder, the meat was moist and served with a sauce that was stupendous! These dishes were worth the price of the meal. I was not as in love with langoustine with a lemon sause was good, but not memorable. There was also a chocolate glacé served in a chocolate bean good but not memorable. The service was outstanding. From beginning to end a three star experience. If it is in your budget go ENJOY.;mai-19;Epicure
7;Incredible Dining Experience;5.0;Food lives up to each of its 3 Michelin Stars. The service is beyond outstanding. The atmosphere is absolutely beautiful .Each of our dishes were fantastic.Still talking about the crab! I loved my sole! Enchanting Macaroon and Chocolate service! Adore this restaurant!;mai-19;Epicure
7;Incomparable;5.0;Our dinner at Epicure was splendid. Right from the moment we entered and were seated on our table, the coordinated service, table setting and food overall was incredible. Glad we chose to come here for a special evening with our family. Impressed with their hospitality and high standards of michelin 3.;oct-18;Epicure
7;WOW!;5.0;best dinner i have ever had.the food is just perfect.the service is even better.we had 2 starters, 2 mains and 1 dessert.the waiter suggested that they will split every course to two so both of us could enjoy everything.we had stuffed Morels and macaroni for starters, both excellent, maybe a bit salty.for mains we had the blue lobster and the pigeon. the lobster was very tasty and the pigeon was perfect, by far the best dish i ever had.for dessert we cocoa ice cream that was very good, not too heavy or sweet and with very intense chocolate flavors.the prices are very high of course.if you can afford it then it is extremely recommended.;avr-19;Epicure
7;Epic Lunch;5.0;Can find no fault with this place. Classic as it is, it delivers on every count as this level of dining should. Service may look stuffy but is far from it, being approachable and even humorous at times.Food is expertly prepared and cooked perfectly. Their signature Bresse farm hen is as silky in texture as chicken comes. Cheese selection was a joy and absolutely delicious. Excellent wine list as well, especially compared to some other haute cuisine restaurants with a surprisingly disappointing selection of French wines, in Paris, go figure.;avr-19;Epicure
7;exquisite;5.0;this place is stunning.they decorate and plate the food so well that one feels like just taking pictures and not eat.We all were also given a tour after we arrived at this place which gives you a better context and a better feel of the entire place thus making the entire experience very memorable.;déc-18;Epicure
7;Flawless;5.0;We dined here finally after I had scheduled a table on two previous trips, yet cancelled due to being a bit intimidated by its reputation. We've dined at several 2 and 3 star Michelin restaurants. This was the best I've experienced. The service and food were near perfect. It was a pleasure to watch the staff work. It was classic fine service without being stuffy. Unfortunately, it was the same evening as the fire at Notre Dame, so my wife and I were saddened by that event. However, this was a truly special dining experience in a beautiful setting.;avr-19;Epicure
7;A most memorable lunch;5.0;When you step into the stunning Le Bristol Hotel it is an experience for the memory book! It is simply gorgeous. We arrived 15 minutes early for our lunch, were given a quick tour and history lesson about the hotel and then escorted to our table for lunch. My son had arranged a specific table with the most stunning view of the courtyard. The staff were amazing, helpful and so very nice. The food was delicious, some of the best I have ever had in my life. I cannot recommend this experience enough! Plan on 3-4 hours for lunch. Do not rush and enjoy!;mars-19;Epicure
7;Fabulous evening at Epicure;5.0;We were seated on time and all enjoyed a coup of champagne while deciding on the tasting menu. The courses were carefully explained and coordinated so that all members of our group saw the courses at the same time. Hard to select a favorite but the stuffed macaroni and poached hen breast probably are a tie. Service was flawless. My only question would be the bread. I was told Epicure grinds it's own wheat and perhaps that is the reason the crust seamed unusually thick and hard. It would have been nice to have been offered alternative choices since we hardly touched the bread.In any case, the restaurant has brought dining to near perfection. Although expensive, an evening at Epicure is an experience always remembered. Cost for 4 was 2,175 euros which included champagne, tasting menus, 2 bottles of wine and coffee. Also left 150 euros although service is included.;avr-19;Epicure
7;Superb;5.0;My wife and I had lunch here during our week long stay in Paris. The food, service, and atmosphere was exquisite. Everything about this place is polished and elegant without being overbearing. The food was magnificent and was matched by the service. This might have been the most expensive lunch I ever had, but well worth it.;mai-18;Epicure
7;Epic;5.0;Highlight of my trip: fantastic food, beautiful settings and atmosphere. The dining area is airy with a relaxing vibe. The service is amazing and faultless. I love the fact that they provide such old school professional service without taking themselves too seriously. I feel comfortable having hours of lunch or dinner here, instead of other places where you have to maintain a certain “decorum.” At the end of the day, a meal is a celebration of food and a good time, the epicure gets it.;avr-19;Epicure
7;A Big YES;5.0;Excellent food to start with. The staff was really friendly. Unlike our experiences with other starred restaurants in Paris, the staff was able to communicate with fluent English even though my wife could speak both English and French. There was also huge selection of wine and fine cheese. The decoration was very meticulous and we love their choice of tableware and utensils. Both of us chose the tasting menu and had a great experience!;août-18;Epicure
7;Great place;5.0;Was with my wife, great place. Definitely worth the money, everything we eat was amazing. Highly recommended.;févr-19;Epicure
7;Top Notch;5.0;If you are looking for the best in Paris, Epicure is your spot. Romantic, elegant, every detail masterfully planned and completed. The chef and team are amazing making sure your every need is cared for throughout the experience. Expensive but worth the splurge.;mars-19;Epicure
7;THE BEST RESTAURANT OF MY INSIGNIFICANT LIFE;5.0;I loved this French gourmet restaurant, the staff is fast and friendly, the presentation is a work of art and the food is excellent.This 3 star restaurant is especially good for these desserts.The restaurant is beautiful with a lot of decor and there is a nice smell in the restaurant.The restaurant accepts animals;mars-19;Epicure
7;THE BEST RESTAURANT OF MY INSIGNIFICANTE LIFE;5.0;This great gourmet restaurant made me discover new flavors.the price is not very expensive (200 € per person) it's great French dises. Their specialties their pastries and their desserts.There are plenty of excellent dishes with delicacies such as lobster;mars-19;Epicure
7;Michelin Star Perfection;5.0;The dinner in one of the most beautiful dinning rooms in Paris, and exceeded our expectations. Every dish was make to perfection. The kitchen of Chef Eric Frechon takes a contemporary approach with an emphasis on bringing out the original flavors of the best ingredients of the region.;sept-18;Epicure

7;Epicure delivered;5.0;I've been avoiding Paris for years, preferring Southern France instead, but as this was my mom and wife's dream destination, I decided to spend New Year in the city of lights. There would be no complete experience without fine dining, hence I searched for the best fit, finally settling on Epicure. Why? Consistent reviews. There are many fantastic restaurants in Paris, many great chefs, but when you have limited time in Paris, you spend top $, and on top of that it might be the only chance for your mom to visit you don't want to take any chance of leaving with sour taste in your mouth. We ordered lunch course, and Epicure delivered 100%. The food was exquisite, service fun, and efficient, and our memories fantastic. There was no dish that would disappoint, from favorites I could mention hare soup, white truffle & hazelnut jelly, SADDLE OF MILK FED LAMB which was so good I would almost put it next to grade 5 japanese wagyu I had few times in Japan (ok, wagyu is still a notch above), mille-feuille... actually I would have to list the whole menu so I stop here. As to drinks 2015 Côte-Rôtie was good but not memorable, however 2013 Chateauneuf du pape was outstanding, the best wine I've had in a while. 2013 was suppose to be one of the so, so years, maybe it was my taste buds tricked or this wine was that good. One small annoying European quirk is the water. I'm perfectly happy with good tap water, common in all American restaurants (mostly for environmental reasons) and spending 60 Euros on 5 bottles of water felt like waste of money, and energy needed to transport these bottles. This is a detail, and a personal thing though, not blaming the restaurant. Overall, very good experience and i would totally come back to try their macaroni truffle, and poached hen. See you next time Epicure.;déc-18;Epicure
7;Amazing;5.0;The food is really delicious and quite picky, the room is very suitable for many guests, and the staff is very professional. We have a great dinner here.thanks;janv-19;Epicure
7;Another excellent visit.;5.0;I stay at Le Bristol 2-3 times a year, and no visit would be complete without diner at Epicure. As with previous visits, dietary requirements happily accommodated. The vegetarian truffle tasting menu was excellent. Service was flawless. The Sommelier’s recommendations were spot on. Highly recommended!;janv-19;Epicure
7;Best restaurant in the world!;5.0;I have been to all 3 michelin starred restaurants and some of the 2 stars, and this is by far the best of all of them. From the moment you walk in, everything little detail is being taken care. The service at Epicure is very personal and genuine, should be a text book example for other restaurants. Food is just fantastic, one of the best French food in the world. Food has always been consistent on every visit. If you could only visit one restaurant in Paris, this would be it. I would rate this place the best restaurant in the world.;févr-18;Epicure
7;Sublime;5.0;Brilliant, gorgeous, whimsical, delicious. If one wonders what three-stars really means, plan a meal here. Food, service, ambiance — everything is perfect. Unmatched. And unforgettable.;déc-18;Epicure
7;Best fine dining experience in Paris (and possibly in Europe);5.0;I've been to numerous fine dining establishments and Epicure was certainly outstanding and memorable.First the service. The staff are attentive to detail, warm, humorous, but very professional and fussy enough at the same time, just the right touch to bring sophistication to the dining experience without making things too stiff and formal. They really pamper their guests. The tasting menu had a well balanced combination of courses, all excellently prepared. If you look for it, there is perfection in so many aspects. For example, the scallops were seared till the inside was just cooked. Any less done-ness would have resulted in a partial sashimi. This gave a tender juicy outcome with a substantial bite and mouthfeel, without any rubberiness.On top of the excellent dishes, the dessert was amazing. Be sure to leave space for the cheeses and bonbons that follow. And the macarons were so amazing. better than those from of the most popular brands (like starting with L and starting with P);déc-18;Epicure
7;A true experience;5.0;Simply superb (one of only 10 three Michelin *** ) in Paris! - Another memorable birthday lunch - thank you Eric Frechon for this culinary voyage! Service was flawless. A special thank you to Medhi (my serveur) and Rémi (formerly worked with Pino in Vancouver). #clefsdorparis;déc-18;Epicure

7;Amazing Michelin 3 star experience;5.0;We were in Paris for a birthday and celebrated here. We had a great time. The decor, service, food, and wine were perfect! One of the best dinners I have ever had. Expensive, but a great experience. The service was amazing.;août-18;Epicure
7;One of the best dinner ✨✨✨;5.0;It was amazing dinner food is very good, service and attention to details out standing I am highly recommend this restaurant well done epicure team really deserved three Michelin star, big thanks to Alicia and Stephane;déc-18;Epicure
7;An excellent dining experience in all ways;5.0;My dinner here was quite surprisingly top-notch as I was expecting only a good experience, my error in believing client reviews too much. The dishes, and the accompaniments from amuse-bouches to mignardises, were of excellent artistry. Service was outstanding, in terms of professionalism and attention to detail, and importantly, sincerity, both for myself and from my observations. So far, my first and only experience here.;déc-18;Epicure
7;If you can have only one three star meal, let it be at Epicure;5.0;We were given a table with a view on the inner courtyard. The restaurant is very luxurious it has excellent service and every dish was a work of art.;déc-18;Epicure
7;Nice experience;5.0;Our lunch in Epicure was very good.If you have the possibility to eat here... DO IT!The food, as well as the service.It was classic, modern and innovative.Thank you. Will come back soon !;déc-18;Epicure
7;Wonderful restaurant;5.0;Wonderful restaurant. Grest dining experience. Located at the hotel Bristol, this is a fine dining experience.;déc-18;Epicure
7;Once in a lifetime dining experience;5.0;We had an amazing night as part of our honeymoon in Paris in November. One of the stops there was Epicure, where we opted for the tasting menu. What a lavish experience with our courses being expertly prepared and exquisitely presented in what seemed to be an endless train of courses.From the Langoustines to Foie Gras and pigeon and hare, it was a treat for the senses: sight, smells and tastes were all exceptional. The attention to detail was stunning, with one if the highlights being the Lemon Sorbet, shaped like a lemon, with kiwi as the lemon cells and a clear sugar coating and leaves. The amuse bouche itself was a piece of art, and complemented the taste with creative, innovative presentation. Over and above the 7 course tasting menu, the staff continued to bring out cheese plates, macaroons cart, which added to the opulence of the evening.The sommelier was knowledgeable and made a great swithc recommendation within our price range, and we ended up with a 1998 Bordeaux which pared well with all out courses. He patiently and expertly consulted on the menu, and we discussed alternatives, which was done in a very advisory, and not pushy manner.The ambiance was French Sophisticated, but with a healthy bustle of the army of wait staff. The price is obviously not cheap, but at the same time, it's truly a once in a lifetime experience.;nov-18;Epicure
7;Reigning as #1 in Paris;5.0;We have such fond memories of this fine dining establishment! The first time we had dinner we loved it !! This time around we enjoyed the lunch! We thought by choosing the lunch three course plus the cheese cart we would be sitting for 2 hours... well we ended up there for 3 hours still!! The reason being was we had such fabulous food and the staff was so funny and amiable! Chef Eric Frechon just kills it with the amazing and delightful dishes every time!! This is a tradition every time we visit this illustrious city!! Highly, highly recommend don’t miss it!!!;déc-18;Epicure
7;Best Meal of my Life;5.0;My wife and I had a fantastic experience at Epicure. The service was impeccable, we especially loved our main hostess Alicia. She brought fun to the experience that might otherwise seemed stuffy and strict. We went for lunch so they had a fixed menu with a few different options for each of the three courses. My wife and I kept with our normal plan to get both options and share, and it was the perfect choice. Our normal assumption that we were getting a starter, an entree and a dessert was extremely incorrect. There must’ve been at least 3-4 other “gifts from the chef” that came between each course. Our favorite was the pre-dessert (didn’t know this existed but I’m so glad it does) and post-dessert (macaroons and chocolates). And to put the last piece of the meal together, we finished with the Jamaican Kona. A 20 euro cup of coffee for two (we split it and it had about 3.5 cups total). They make it in front of you using the most complex coffee maker I’ve ever seen. Expensive, but worth it. BEST COFFEE EVER. It was a meal we will remember always and even with the hefty price tag, it was worth every penny to us. We will definitely be back :);nov-18;Epicure
7;Great beginning to our France trip;5.0;We had dinner here, choosing the Chef's tasting menu which was a delight. We also enjoyed a glass of Chassagne Montr champaign and some wine with dinner (extra charge), with wonderful assistance from the sommelier in choosing which wine to pair with our dinner.Staff was wonderful in every way, making for a comfortable, relaxing dinner at this 3 star Michelin restaurant, even when an appetizer that is presented vertically on a spear-like implement fell off the plate upon table placement. It was scooped up quietly with a small smile, and replaced expeditiously.Presentation was beautiful for each course, pleasing to the eye as well as the palate. We wouldn't hesitate to return for another meal.;oct-18;Epicure
7;Perfect;5.0;Simply perfect. Luxurious hotel that harbors this great french institution by now. Wonderful premises, the restaurant faces a wonderful inside garden, but is decorated with taste, sophistication and refinement.Coming back, nothing lost its luster! And as far as food is concerned, Chef Eric Frechon is inccommand of a wonderful team! genius! Inventive, delicate, tasteful, from bread to dessert and after dessert. Looking forward to coming back. Bravo!;nov-17;Epicure
7;Great atmosphere, good food but average service;4.0;If you are in Paris for a weekend getaway with your partner, Epicure may well be one of your options, and it may even seem like the best one thanks to its great ambience. Food will certainly not disappoint you. Everything is prepared with super care, and it is delicious. However, at this level, one looks for a special taste, or combination of ingredients never executed/tried before or at least a sign that will make you come to this place every time you are in the city. Unfortunately, the plates lack this effect. Especially when you know that there are so many other great restaurants where you pay the equivalent but receive much more, you consider this experience as a pleasant one. This is also related to quality of service which is not impressive, when taking into account other restaurants in the same league. It lacks coordination, and precision.;oct-18;Epicure
7;Not to my taste;4.0;"I struggled with how to review Epicure where we had lunch. It was elegant. The service was attentive, at times excessive. The wine list was extensive but the wine by glass list was limited. The food seemed more focused on ""unique"" than anything else. The langoustines in orange were excellent but my pigeon was slightly under-done.As an ""experience"" it was worthwhile but we had more enjoyable meals in less auspicious places in Paris.";sept-18;Epicure
7;French Dining at its Finest!;5.0;Located in Le Bristol hotel, L'Epicure, was one of the best lunches I have had in recent memory. The ambiance, the quality of the food, and the service were flawless and inviting. Epicure requires men to wear suit jackets, so I was a bit intimidated about the type of experience it would be. I had been to other “jackets required” restaurants and as good as the meals were, I found the services to be stoic and austere. In other words, they were a bit too formal for my taste. Nonetheless, after reading rave reviews, I took the plunge (definitely splurged) and booked a table for lunch. I was not disappointed one bit. The service was formal, but relaxed and the food was incredible. Chef Éric Fréchon creates a wondrous meal that incorporates traditional French cooking with modern twists. My friends and I were escorted to our table when we entered Le Bristol hotel. The restaurant has an open, elegant feel situated next to the hotel’s beautiful atrium that gives you more of a nature feel rather than an urban feel. Multiple wait staff greet you with smiles that never falter throughout the 3 hour journey. We opted for the full tasting menu since it was our last meal in Paris. To start, we were served small three amuse bouches on one plate. Additionally, we were given two more dishes as part of the amuse bouche: foie gras in soup-like mixture with shaved truffles and brioche. The servers came by and offered us different breads that they make in house. Our first course was Large Langoustines. The lobster was cooked perfectly. The second course is Chef Fréchon’s signature dish: Stuffed Macaroni. As stated on the menu: “with black truffle, artichoke and duck foie gras gratinated with mature Parmesan cheese.” I would return just to have this dish. The sauce was savory goodness. Normally, you are not supposed to dip your bread into the leftover sauce after finishing a dish (not considered appropriate French dining etiquette, as one of my French dining companions mentioned), but the servers encouraged us dip the bread and savor the sauce. They could not have been any more correct! My plate was sparkling white afterwards. The meal continued to progress seamlessly with the servers answering our questions with great detail. The duck was perfect. the desserts were innovative. The presentations were second to none.L'Epicure is definitely well deserving of its Michelin 3 Stars. Chef Fréchon was not there that day, so we did not meet the creative genius. I have to applaud his team for making us the perfect meal before heading back home. I can’t wait to return again and explore more of his traditional, yet modern cooking. L'Epicure does have an a la carte menu, a shortened lunch menu and the full tasting menu available. I would recommend going at least once, as the bill can add up! That being said, it is well worth the visit!;oct-18;Epicure
7;An EXPERIENCE, not just dining;5.0;Every part of the experience was magical. The staff was so amazing and attentive. You feel like royalty with all the pampering. Every course is like a work of culinary art and too good looking to eat...but you do! The flavor combinations and presentation are feast for the senses. The sommelier has excellent wine pairing offerings that should not be missed. We savored every minute of this experience. For the four of us it was $1400 EU. It is at the higher end, but you're in Paris, live a little!;oct-18;Epicure
7;Amazing service and food;5.0;We had the pleasure of eating at Epicure in October. We chose the ala crate selecting the langoustine and leeks as our first courses followed by the duck and whiting fish as our mains. We were served the most amazing glass of champagne with our amuse bouche. The first courses were so wonderful and the main dishes were exquisite and accompanied by the best glass of wine for each. And the deserts were magical in their presentation and taste. The excellence of the food was well matched by the wonderful and personable staff and sommelier. This was the top two of the five michelin star restaurants we had the pleasure of visiting in France.;oct-18;Epicure
7;2nd visit just as Tantalising as the 1st;5.0;I visited for the first time back in June and true to my initial review I followed by own advice and returned recently from the UK just to dine here again. No surprise the food was just as good and I was delighted to see some changes to the set menu, in particular the amazing new desserts on offer, and yes the bread was still as amazing! Whilst obviously pricey I still rated 5 star value for money as an absolute culinary delight that lasted nearly 5 hr for the tasting menu. Still possibly my favourite dining experience so far and I have been lucky enough to eat my way around the world!;sept-18;Epicure
7;Really 3 Michelin starts with White Truffle Alba by Urbani;5.0;The concept of them is great because to compare to other Michelin star , in Epicure they let you eat not just look the pictures of the food or plate.Good Top and service incredible.We loved.;oct-18;Epicure
7;Grand ,Opulence & expensive;4.0;I was lucky to have been invited for lunch celebration for a friends wedding anniversary, very small group of 4 pax, very formal and elegant place, i found service was not up to par on what the restaurant stands for.. lack of attention to details, excess bread crumbs was not cleaned away when guest goes for a toilet break, napkin was not folded back.food was excellent, i believe they over charge wine by 500% on the glass wine served was $40 btl -charge38 euro for a glass, wine was $25 btl charge 28 euro for a glass. this seems to be a little off not even great years just 2011 and 2016 bottles. thats my opinion only, had a great time food was great, will visit again;oct-18;Epicure
7;Beautiful restaurant, excellent service and wonderful food!;5.0;We enjoy going to Michelin restaurants and trying the tasting menu. We were able to do that at Epicure, with one substitution. They had pigeon on the menu which I didn't want. They happily substituted the lamb instead. We had a delicious seven course meal, with amuse Bouche, special starters and lemon ice with limoncello. Each course was wonderful with the whiting fish, macaroni, and lamb being exceptional. They were extremely attentive to us, however, when it came time to pay the bill, it was hard to find someone to help. We finally got someone to come over to take our credit card. By that time, we had been at the table for four hours and we had enough sitting. Other than that little glitch, it was a near perfect evening. I highly recommend it and hope to return soon,.;oct-18;Epicure
7;One of the Finest!!;5.0;A stop off from NYC in Paris allowed us to visit Epicure. This restaurant is the epitome of what every three Michelin star restaurant experience should be . Having visited two of the ten three Michelin star restaurants in Paris, Epicure was absolute perfection. Alongside Le Cinq and George V, Epicure is one of the best restaurants in Paris. Our table overlooked a garden as perfect as the food and service was. The langoustine was simply exquisite, as was every other part of our meal.;oct-18;Epicure
7;Excellent service and food;5.0;I went to Epicure last month, the service here was extraordinary. It was a magical evening. Do not leave this place without trying the desert. I recommend this place for a nice occasion.;sept-18;Epicure
7;Best Romantic Dinner;5.0;Took my wife as a get away from the children and this place is worth the service. Loved the service and showed us why Paris is the city love. Thank you for making our holiday a great one;oct-18;Epicure
7;Delightful experience!;5.0;The entire experience at Epicure was delightful and exquisite! The wait staff were friendly and playful, encouraging us to practice our broken French, as they unveiled dish after dish of wonder and deliciousness - I had the perfectly cooked egg, young piegon and moka coffee from Ethiopia and would definitely recommend these dishes! Even the bread was addictive! There were so many surprise additions to the courses - amuse bouche, palate cleansers, the chest of macarons and chocolates etc. - that we were really unable to eat another bite by the end of the meal! We were also never rushed and just left to indulge and enjoy ourselves at a leisurely pace - service was also discreet but efficient. The atmosphere was relaxing and comfortable and truly made for a most enjoyable meal!;sept-18;Epicure
7;The Master Eric Frechon;5.0;Today was a monumental day for me , this week im doing a gastronomic trip with my wife and although i have been so disapointed @ Guy savoy , was so exited to go to Epicure and discover le meilleur ouvrier de France Eric Frechon ! And what wonderful experience it has been ! From the monumental Bristol , each bite done by Frechon will give your palate new experiences and flavors so enjoyable and magical ! The staff are so proffesional its incredible how attentive they are to every small detail . Delphine the someliere is so talented and proffesionel she makes the experience even better . Cant wait to come back to one of the best restaurants in the world .;oct-18;Epicure
7;intimacy and luxury;5.0;The place is interesting, it is a large restaurant that has been able to keep a cozy and intimate atmosphere at each table. Food is up to the luxury standard, as is the price... It is for each one to decide if one wants to buy a bag or a Hermes bag, to have a great dinner or an Epicure dinner...;avr-18;Epicure
7;Book early;5.0;There is nothing I can add. Just go if you can afford it. Tell the wine Stewart how much you want to spend and he will find you one of the best wines you ever had;sept-18;Epicure
7;Mikey speaks;5.0;we first began dining at the Epicure, Bristol's 3* restaurant about 5 years ago and have tried many others but it remains among our 2 favorites. Elegant, with tables widely spaced, exemplary service, our two most unique dishes are the grilled giant leek stuffed with oysters and the poulet de Bresse for two in pig's bladder the service for which is in itself memorable (believe it's a recipe originally done by Paul Bocuse). BTW. the photo above is accurate;oct-18;Epicure
7;I've dined all over the world, Epicure was to date, the best dining experience of my life.;5.0;"I know many may blurt out the ""best meal of my life"" statement easily but I can easily say I absolutely do not. The last restaurant that held this title was Grant Achatz's Alinea in Chicago and that meal was in Jan 2011 and I have had hundreds of great meals since then but Epicure was truly special and well deserving of the title. After much thought it fractionally edged out Alinea for reasons I will explain later but both will always hold a special place in my heart.For extra special culinary experiences I like to use the ""Zagat"" system to review so I will be covering Decor / Ambiance, Service and Food separately, even though they all are quite intertwined and ideally work in symbiosis. Decor / AmbianceEpicure is located in the Bristol Hotel in Faubourg Saint Honore, so from the moment you enter the hotel you know you are already in a special place. The hotel foyer is massive so instead of roaming around like a lost puppy, I went straight towards the reception. As I approached I had the attention of two people long before I got close to the desk. I just said ""Epicure?"" with my hands up and immediately one of them hurried around to escort me. Upon arrival to the restaurant's entrance the receptionist already knew my name, always a nice touch, and escorted me to a great spot on a comfortable couch opposite a chair overlooking the restaurant and all of its glory. Vaulted ceilings with intricate crown molding, large paned glass doors garnished with lush burgundy floral drapes that frame expansive views to the hotel courtyard. Large flower bouquets on smaller center tables and approximately 15 larger tables of various sizes, all with generous space between them. Gold glowing wall candelabras, uplighting accents on the window drapes and soft down lights from the ceilings on each table. Right away you feel like royalty but not in a way where you feel stiff and in an overly formal atmosphere. To the contrary, I felt relaxed right away as I settled in the firm but very comfortable couch seat with my right arm rested on a perfectly sized arm pillow. In Paris the Sept sunset was right around my 8:30 reservation so it was a delight to watch the colors in the courtyard change from a red orange to blues and black with sparkling lights.ServiceImmediately upon entering Epicure you truly feel you are in the center of a perfectly choreographed ballet. The cast of 20+ dancers moving in such synchronicity there were times I would almost chuckle a bit at how perfect it was. There are ways people enter and exit and paths taken to deliver dishes and other to take them away. Some taking orders, others on watch to see if anyone looks up and needs anything. A system of pure perfection that obviously took years of trial and error formulate. The sommelier was really something special. He was younger and energetic which I liked and right away he felt a challenge to get down to what works for me. We had a short conversation about wines and all the while I could see his gears turning. His face lit up and he said I'll be right back with some things I think you'll like. A few minutes later he was back with three glasses with a nice taster pour in each. Keep in mind this was just for my pre-meal glass. it only got better from there.One major tip which I have really not shared on TA but tell friends all the time. If you really want to experience a restaurant, especially one of this caliber, I highly recommend eating alone. I know this frightens some to death and for others it's just not a possibility but you will be amazing how your experience will differ dining alone vs with one or more people. When alone, in general most servers will be much more engaging, offer more suggestions and even give extras and perks they normally wouldn't. I was watching other tables with two or more and I saw several that never spoke a word to anyone other than ordering. At the same time the staff will of course respect your privacy and won't want to intrude on your time with your own company. Worst case, even if you are with another, I would make an effort to chat it up and you'll find your experience will be exponentially enhanced. I had servers and the sommelier stopping by the entire night bringing extras and just chatting about everything. The head server for my table was also younger and she had the perfect combination of professionalism and being laid back. We chatted about everything from how she ended up working there to travel and of course food. When I was through most of the meal, I told her that since 2011 Alinea was the best meal of my life and after seven years, Epicure now has that crown. I said I'm not sure if the chef is here but please tell him that if you could. She paused with a smile and said "" I think you should tell him that yourself"". Sure enough she arranged for me to have a tour of the kitchen and a short chat with Eric Frechon. Eric didn't speak any english so she translated for me. A truly special moment and most likely would never happen if I was with anyone else.FoodFor my meal I ended up choosing the tasting menu with the wine pairing after going over the choices in depth with my server and I was very thankful that I did. I never would have ordered as much going ala carte or received all the amazing creations in between courses the tasting menu affords you. I also want to stress it wasn't too much food at all and I'm actually used to eating smaller meals in general. Everything flowed perfectly. if you do opt for the tasting, I'd set aside the rest of the evening. I arrived at 8:30 and left just before midnight. Granted I had a kitchen tour and quite a bit of conversation and extras which definitely added extra time but amazingly it flew by. What I truly loved about the spectrum of dishes is that they were not gimmicky or in anyway over the top as you might find others at this level do. Everything was simply made the absolute best it could be in the eyes of Chef Frechon. A truly unique symphony of temperatures, textures and flavors. One course that stood our was the line-caught Whiting Fish which was topped with an incredible flaky bread crust with almonds on top of spinach and olive oil infused with curry and pequillos pepper. Just typing it out sounds epic but nothing could describe the experience of eating it. Another favorite was a plate with three medium sizes rigatoni type pasta tubes stuffed with black truffle, artichoke and duck foie gras and topped with gratinated parmesan. I think you are getting the picture. From start to finish there wasn't a single item that I could say I had had before and probably won't have again. Even the wines chosen were all small batch french wines and non are exported outside of France. I should know, I took notes of them all and tried to order a few them after returning home.In summary, it truly was the best meal of my life to date and I would highly encourage anyone with a love of food to experience it. It's tough to get a reservation so definitely plan a few months ahead. They only book online but if they don't have availability for your dates, definitely call during the day and see if they can fit you in, it worked for me. Yes, it's expensive but you are absolutely getting what you pay for and life is short....Enjoy it!";sept-18;Epicure
7;Michelin Star Experience of a lifetime!;5.0;Visited in April, 2017 while we were on a trip to Paris. This is a foodie group, so I was not surprised when I received an email confirmation that we were going to Epicure while in Paris. I raised my eyebrows at the cost of the tasting menu, but crossed my fingers that it would be worth all 340 Euros. It was perfect!!! We arrived at 7:58pm for our 8:00pm reservation and was whisked directly to our table. From the moment we sat down to the moment we pulled ourselves from the table, we were treated like royalty. The food was so very rich, and while the portions were small, I felt as if I ate enough food to last me for the next 3 days. The baked macaroni w/ foie gras was my absolute favorite and the foie gras is baked in the dish so it was perfect. This was my first time eating Pigeon, which was my least favorite, but for 340 Euros I ate it all! We of course added the wine pairings and glass of champagne. Total bill for 3 was 1,510.00 Euros. If you are looking to have a once in a lifetime experience, go to Epicure!!!!;oct-17;Epicure
7;What experience!😀😀😀;5.0;The best food experience i ever tried all 5 stars ! From food to staff attention to details is amazing will be back on my seconds holiday in France! Strongly recommend!;mai-18;Epicure
7;The Absolute Best;5.0;I was really looking forward to try a 3 Michelin stars restaurant, specially in Paris. It didn’t disappoint at all, the staff is very very gracious, professional and friendly. The food options are delicious, I really love it when such a restaurant has “A La Carte Menu” aside from the degustation menu. I was ready to pay for a much more expensive bill, at 600€ including drinks and tip, the words “affordable” or “reasonable” do not fit but I think the dinner experience was very worthy. One of the waitresses was a bit annoying because she was very pushy about wine when I asked vodka as an aperitif, I feared it would spoil the night but it didn’t.;sept-18;Epicure
7;Fine dining at its best. Impeccable!;5.0;This is my second visit to l’epicure. As usual, exceeds my expectation. No wonder it consistently ranks at the top of the list. A must if you enjoy fine dining. Look forward to my next visit.;sept-18;Epicure
7;sweet carts;5.0;its best place in all of restaurant in paris that i eat pasta . the staff was so nice with me and the tables was so beautiful but the price was alittle high;avr-18;Epicure
7;Great experience;4.0;I’ve been to Epicure in the context of a business event in Paris within Bristol hotel in Faubourg Saint Honore. Great location, comfortable accommodation, high level of service and customer care. Food was well prepared out of a mix of French and continental cuisine. Recommended for business events in Paris.;sept-18;Epicure
7;MacTastic;5.0;Macaroni, macaroons, sweet carts. The whole shebang. Even Vegetarian options. Love it. Prices are reasonable and great atmosphere. Thanks to the wait staff. Afraid to butcher the name of my server.;sept-18;Epicure
7;Very nice!;5.0;Beautiful interior design, delicious cocktails and great oysters. The selection of wine is also very good. Chef does a great job with an unusual menu. Cozy place to be with partner or friends;juil-18;Epicure
7;Perfect;5.0;An outstanding dining experience with an excellent preparation and presentation. It is one of my favourites in Paris and I look forward to returning again soon for the exquisite food and perfect service.;juil-18;Epicure
7;Great experience!;5.0;Nice restaurant in a beautiful area of Paris. A different Michelin experience compared to other places. Of course dishes have a lot of work behind them but you can still taste the amazing quality of the products. Particularly impressive was the service. I would recommend it 100%!;oct-17;Epicure
7;Gastronomic marathon;5.0;Food is definitely the best that I’ve ever had. Each course is a multi-sensory experience. Wine list is extensive, and the sommelier is knowledgeable enough to help navigate the selection. Service is impeccable but not stuffy. Made the experience not only luxurious but also simply fun!;août-18;Epicure
7;Wonderful setting, flavors, and service.;5.0;We always have the tasting menu when eating at places like these. This one was packed with original flavors. accompanied by perfectly chosen wines.;août-18;Epicure
7;Yet another excellent dining experience.;5.0;I’ve had the pleasure of dining at many of the top restaurants of the world (based on Michelin, San Pellegrino Top 100, etc) and can categorically say that Epicure provides exceptional service & exceptional food every time. It is indeed a class above. Being vegetarian I contacted the restaurant prior, and they happily arranged a tasting menu (as with all my previous visits). Each course was delicious, with a few highlights being...- Stuffed macaroni with black truffle and artichoke, gratinated with mature Parmesan cheese- Eggplant caviar with cumin in a zucchini flower, yellow bell pepper juice flavored with argan oil- Strawberry from the field in a meringue shell, wild strawberries, basilic sorbet and vanilla foam.As with my previous six visits, service was exceptional, the venue delightful and Sommeliers recommendations first class. Treat yourself and book!;août-18;Epicure
7;BEST SERVICE EVER;5.0;Great experience with great service. Would definitely recommend this restaurant. One of the best service in Paris;sept-17;Epicure
7;Best Lunch We Have Ever Had;5.0;Wow!! If you do not visit and enjoy Epicure you are missing out. We wanted a long leisurely lunch and this hit the mark. Outstanding friendly service, everything we ate was worth the Michelin stars this restaurant has earned. Just go!;août-18;Epicure
7;AMAZING!;5.0;We had a absolutely amazing time dining at Epicure for our night in Paris to celebrate our anniversary. The staff were exceptional and the food was so delicious. We were very satisfied after all the courses and beautiful wine.;août-18;Epicure
7;Definitely Worth The Price;5.0;The food was fantastic. Everything was like a show/entertainment. I've never felt so please with the amount I paid for just food. The waitresses/waiters came out in sync with everything. We got to visit the kitchen after our meal. They even gave us macaroons to take home. It was SOOOO good. The most interesting part was the tea/honey that was like a round ball on spoons. It burst in our mouths. They said it was made with seaweed (the shell). It did not look like seaweed at all.;mai-18;Epicure
7;Absolutely exceptional;5.0;My husband and I ate at Epicure our first night in Paris to celebrate our ten-year anniversary. From the first minute of our 7:30 pm reservation, the experience was just phenomenal. The attention of the wait staff, the service, and the food, oh the food, was INCREDIBLE. As we knew we were dining at a 3-Michelin star restaurant, we had high expectations for what to expect. but the experience exceeded even our expectations. The personalities of all of the waiters and waitresses were exceptional. They were smart, funny, kind, and polite. The food was gorgeously presented and tasted so good. We both got the tasting menu and were so glad that we had. It was a 3.5 hour long experience that we will remember forever. Best way we could’ve celebrated our 10-year anniversary.;août-18;Epicure
7;Not the number one...;3.0;After traveling the world for years, we have, often times, been disappointed by the number one restaurant on any city list. For those of you who travel a lot like us, you can probably understand what we mean by that.... Paris is unfortunately not any different. Here again, you will find the real gems of the french culinary culture lower in the ranking and we definitely advise you to skip this overhyped and totally overpriced place. Yes it is good. Yes they are friendly and the service is ok. And they deserve 3 stars for that. But nothing justifies the price tag at the end of the meal. We have eaten in dozens of three stars around the world which were equally expensive but at least they offered a unique culinary experience with their innovative and refine dishes. Here you will get a ridiculously expensive chicken (even if cooked in a bladder it still remains a chicken) and a very very heavy cannelloni dish filled with truffle and foie gras (combining great ingredients together doesn’t make it a great dish if the fatty taste overwhelmes the rafinesse of them)... Anyways, we tried the number one, again, and we were disappointed, again. Go down the list, there lies the real french cuisine.;mars-18;Epicure
7;Parfait!!! Perfect!;5.0;Having dined at many Michelin starred restaurants, we have discovered that Epicure is everything we want in a 3 Michelin star Parisian restaurant. Our first visit was in October last year. It was the third 3 starred restaurant we visited during that whirlwind gastronomic trip. The first was Lasarte in Barcelona which had interesting food but lacked service and personality, followed by Guy Savoy in Paris (a nostalgic former favourite) that we ended up visiting twice - once for lunch and once for dinner. The maitre d' Hubert tried to weave his magic and even organised a tour of the kitchen for us, but it didn't quite hit the mark. And then there was our lunch at Epicure. We are huge francophiles and Epicure just captured our hearts from the moment we stepped in. This is classic French haute cuisine at its finest, without the stuffiness one would expect. Everything is done to utmost perfection. Many Michelin starred restaurants fail to understand that an unforgettable meal is not just the cuisine. It is also the ambiance, a good wine recommendation from the sommelier, a friendly conversation with the servers. It is a dance - gracious, fluid and beautiful. To witness this is like admiring a masterpiece. We found all that here at Epicure.Imagine our delight when we returned this year in June to be blown away yet again by another dazzling meal. Monsieur Ségui and his team are amazing. Everything was perfection - from the moment we were shown to our table, to the attention to detail (my husband doesn't tolerate raw onions but failed to mention it to the staff. So he didn't eat the amuse bouche of 'salad niçoise revisited'. When his plate was being cleared, the staff enquired if he did not like the dish. He mentioned his aversion to raw onions. Immediately the dish was whisked away and a new one appeared without the raw onions in it.) Unlike some other starred restaurants where the staff are too formal and cold, the staff here are warm and friendly whilst maintaining the appropriate formalities.Having met the great man Bernard Neveu, chef sommelier of Le Bristol, during our last visit, we knew we were in good hands with his team. A quick chat to the sommelier about our preferences helped us decide on a lovely bottle to go with our meal. We have found that the wine recommendations here at Epicure have always been spot on.This second visit was to celebrate a family member's birthday. It was so wonderful that we were compelled to ask if it was possible to make a last minute reservation before the end of our trip. They were very kind to fit us in. Our second meal was just as dazzling and amazing. I cannot imagine how much work goes into maintaining this incredible level of perfection with every service but somehow Monsieur Ségui and his team do this everyday. Bravo!!This is now our favourite restaurant in Paris.;juin-18;Epicure
7;An amazing dining experience. 3 Michelin Stars well-deserved!;5.0;The staff was friendly and welcoming, the service was outstanding, the atmosphere was sophisticated and warm, and the food was exquisite. My wife and I had an early reservation, and we were the first diners to be seated. however, the room quickly filled over the next 30 minutes. We had the chef's dégustation and were not disappointed! The ingredients were of the highest quality, and the preparation was impeccable. The chef has a particular talent for integrating texture and flavor, such that the texture of each dish seemed to enhance the experience of the wonderful flavors. The wine list is significant (and pricey), but I deferred to the sommelier, who was extremely helpful in selecting an excellent and reasonably-priced bottle of white burgundy that paired perfectly with the early courses and a glass of delicious Côte-Rôtie for the duck. We selected a half bottle of 2002 d'Yquem to go with the exceptional array of cheeses from the cart. My highest recommendation.;juil-18;Epicure
7;Still the Finest Dining Experience in Paris;5.0;Not sure how Epicure does it but they’ve managed to sustain their extraordinary level of quality food , service and ambiance. In a city filled with fabulous restaurants Epicure is still the Best. Dined outdoors this time on a beautiful July evening . While the dining room is beautiful this added another lovely touch to our experience. Save room for their signature lemon dessert as a Light and delicious ending to a sensational meal.;juil-18;Epicure
7;Once in a lifetime;5.0;The entire experience was magical. Service was faultless and the food was delicious.A very special evening.;sept-17;Epicure
7;Truly outstanding dining experience;5.0;This was our second time eating at Epicure (the last time was two years ago, and it was my first time at a 3-star Michelin). Having now eaten in many 3-star Michelin restaurants, I can say unhesitatingly that this is THE best restaurant I have ever had the pleasure of eating at. Everything is perfect, from the beautiful room, to the warm welcome at the reception, to the many delicious courses in the tasting menu, to the incredible wine list, and of course, the perfect service (including making immediate changes to the menu when I asked the waiter to remove the amuse bouche because I don't eat meat) which was friendly and smooth. Every plate was beautifully presented, and by the end I did not think I could eat one more bite, but then...there was the dessert cart! I can't wait until our next visit to Paris to come here again.;juin-18;Epicure
7;Most amazing experience of my life;5.0;I had the most amazing experience at Epicure on the 20th June 2018. The food was absolutely divine the best culinary experience. I'm still in awe of this experience i will forever cherish it.;juin-18;Epicure
7;Time spent worth! Very Nice Place;5.0;Very tasty food we people had! The services were fantastic, we were confused to choose for which restaurant we should go for? then we came across by via TripAdvisor. Glad to choose them !;juin-18;Epicure
7;Amazing;5.0;Me and my business partners from Paris were here on a lunch. I must say that I'm really amazed by the decorations inside, garden is too beautiful, everything is in French style and represents Paris in a very good way.;mars-18;Epicure
7;nice;4.0;The experience was extraordinary. This restaurant provides a culinary experience that sets the bar for excellence of the highest caliber. Merci beau coup!;août-17;Epicure
7;Fantastic;5.0;Although i am giving another michelin restaurant a 5 star, if i had to chose between two, EPICURE would be the MIST DO! fantastic service, delicious food, pleasant environment. If you are doing a michelin restaurant, this is a must!;juin-18;Epicure
7;Amazing Experience;5.0;Me and my wife went today for lunch there...we had 2 starters,2 main dishes and 2 deserts...everything was great...the service amazing...i have been to many Michelin stars restaurants and this one for sure is one of my best...;juin-18;Epicure
7;Perfection;5.0;Epicure is the epitome of what every three Michelin star restaurant experience should be.My husband and i have visited 6 of the ten three (***) Michelin star restaurants in Paris and Epicure was absolute perfection. Alongside Le Cinq/ George V, Epicure is our favorite restaurant in Paris. The table we were seated in overlooked a garden as perfect as the food and service. The langostintine was exquisite-- as was every other part of the meal. Some may find the decor a bit dated, the curtains in particular. However, i found the decor charming.;juil-17;Epicure
7;One of the best dining experiences ever;5.0;Dining for lunch last week and as a large group of eight chose the tasting menu, every course was exceptional including the many extras provided not on the menu, service was excellent and incredibly attentive throughout and the best was the bread with every course. I would happy travel from the UK just to dine there again.;juin-18;Epicure
7;Experience a 5 star michelin rating at its finest;5.0;This is by far the most amazing restaurant we have been too. The service is impecable. The food was absolutely the best. The presentation;juin-18;Epicure
7;Stunning world class cuisine;5.0;I've dined here twice, several years apart and it's my favourite restaurant in the world. After sampling most of the 3 Michelin star restaurants in Paris last time round, I came to the conclusion that Epicure was my favourite. This most recent meal only confirmed this for me. The quality which stands out for me every dish, every time is the incredible synergy of flavours.;févr-18;Epicure
7;Amazing service.;5.0;I went to Epicure for lunch and had the seasonal menu, the service was fenomenal, everybody in the staff were extremely polite and helpful, they even offer me a book or newspaper to read since I was by myself. The place is nice and clean with a great atmosphere, the food was really good. My final check over 200 euros including coffee but they give you so much food in small quantities, including cheeses, WONDERFUL cheeses, when I left I was really full. I take my hat off for the staff, the couple next to me were rude and treated the waitress worst than a servant but she never lost her temper and always was very very professional with these couple. I highly recommend this place for a nice culinary experience well worth it.;juin-18;Epicure
7;Still spectacular;5.0;"I had the pleasure of dining here four years ago and came for lunch this June with my mother and friend. This is still a restaurant on top of them all. Best of the best. Simply brilliant. My mother and best friends believes this one to be the most beautiful and wonderful restaurant in the world. It's my personal second. A marvellous, gorgeous and inviting restaurant. The beatiful and tasteful decor is reflected on the table and on the plates. Actually, quite perfect for lunch and I can recommend the four course seasonal menu:""Poivrace"" artichoke in shell juice and garlic flowers and my friends gilthead seabream. Both magnificent.Veal sweetbreads with anchovies, veal juice, oysters, capers and lemon. Quite a heavy serving. Very, very good.Epicures cheese selection: Just brilliant.For dessert: ""Moka coffee from Ethiopia"" with hazelnuts, caramel covered im a milk chocolate fence. Beautiful and excellent. Maybe heavy for lunch in June, but exceptional. My friends rhubarb opposite light with sorbet and greek yougurt. Fresh and just as brilliant. Whatever your taste desires: Everything is magnificent.No need to mention the exceptional amouse bouche for starter and refreshments, some extras and madeleines. Everything so wonderful. Perfect service from the entire staff, sommelier and waiters. The perfect restaurant!";juin-18;Epicure
7;UNFORGETTABLY INCREDIBLE;5.0;A phenomenal experience like no other!Food and Wine pairings could not be faulted. You cannot put into words the attention to detail they put into everything they do, going above and beyond to ensure you leave with memories that will last a life time.To the Team at Epicure, Thank you very much for decorating the table with red roses to celebrate our honeymoon.;avr-18;Epicure
7;Great dining experience;5.0;This is a first class dining experience with great presentation and meticulous service. The food is presented beautifully. It is a very fancy looking dining room with ample space between tables. Definitely need to make reservations.;mai-18;Epicure
7;Nothing better than this restaurant;5.0;We have eaten there 4 times. Every time .. we love it. Fabulous service. Best French food in the world. Creative dishes. Great wine selections. Dessert to die for. My wife and I are addicted to this restaurant;mai-18;Epicure
7;Excellent food, but not really extraordinary, and too expensive;4.0;We had the lunch menu here. The atmosphere and the experience are unique, but remember you have to wear a jacket inside the restaurant even if it’s 30 degrees centigrade outside...The dishes were all excellent, but I have to say we’ve had better in 2 star and 1 star restaurants. The cheese platter was perfect, no doubt about that. The service was excellent. The sommelier did a fantastic job, she chose great wines for each and every dish. But again, no dish by itself was extraordinary. We even thought that the taste of the oysters was too dominant in more than one dish. And the price is a bit too high. We know this is the standard in 3 star restaurants, but still...460 Euros for a lunch for 2 is too much. So, our feelings are a bit ambivalent. Great experience, but too pricy and the holistic impression was better than each dish for itself.;mai-18;Epicure
7;Good food and nice place;5.0;On our short trip to paris this was one of our best restaurant! An experience to repeat again in the future;mai-18;Epicure
7;Unbelievable Place;5.0;Went here with work colleagues when on a business trip. There's no much to be negative about, food was excellent, staff where well trained, wine selection was fabulous. Worth a visit, no pressure on you to hurry once you book a table you can stay as long or as short as you wish. Pierre our waiter was fabulous and appreciate all his help and service.;août-17;Epicure
7;If you only go to one three-star restaurant, go here.;5.0;"Ticked all the boxes on what a three-star should be -- L'Epicure could well be the quintessential example. Elaborate cuisine, preparation, and plating, check. A beautiful dining room, check. Impeccable service, check. Wine tome with which one could kill a large cat and/or expense account, check.This was an elaborate ""three course"" lunch with at least several additional surprises plus the huge cart of mignardises. And let's not forget the Christofle cheese cart, either!Wines by the glass were pricey (€24-40) but worth it. they were really fantastic and a fair price considering the bottles. (I didn't record everything, but the Chappaz Fendant Président Troillet had delightful honey and orange blossom notes.)As we were the last table of the afternoon (and possibly because the POS system was acting up) the staff were kind enough to give us a tour of the kitchen, which alone was easily larger than the average city apartment. Producing such elaborate dishes requires a large team and a lot of space!If you go to one three-star restaurant in Paris, this should be it.";mai-18;Epicure
7;One of the very finest restaurants;5.0;I ever had the privilege to dine at.One must feel compassion for assessors from Michelin or La Liste, whose enviable, but by no means easy task it is to rate these perfect-plus establishments. All of the worlds top restaurants I have visited have standout features. Be it some extra magical dishes, impeccable service or intoxicating ambiance. The Epicure offers up all of these with Parisian flair and old world elegance. Our lunch consisted of the seasonal menu for me, the standout dish was the sea urchin, my wife ordered a la carte and discovered a new favourite dessert: the Peruvian cocoa pod. Menu and wine choices depicted below. A special round of applause goes to the four amuse bouche presentations. one could say that they alone were worth the visit to Eric Frechon’s exceptional restaurant.;avr-18;Epicure
7;Perfect every time;5.0;"I have now been here around 20 times and this restaurant deliver world class food and service every time. What i find so rare here is that they manage to keep up the extremly high level of quality every time and still have a moment of surprise for you.I don`t think people appreciate enough the freedom of having a big a la carte menu in addition to the set menu in a 3 star michelin, it gives you the opportunity to choose the dishes you want. They keep their classics and at the same time the menu changes often enough so you always have a new dish to try out even if it is not so long since last visit.The service here is for me is the most proffesional, friendly, funny, laidback and knowledgeable in any restaurant i have been to(Hitami, Olivier 2x, Benjamin, Matthieu, Julia, Dèlphine, Bernard, Mehdi, Estelle, Rèmi, and many more). To eat here is an amazing experience every time and i still have butterflies in my stomach every time i walk in the door and a big smile when i go. We had the caviar sologne dish which is fluffy pommes purè with smoked haddock and french caviar from sologne, it was the best caviar dish i ever had( second best was at Le Gabriel), the combination was perfect. The macaroni with foie gras, truffle and aged parmesan is amazing every time. The wild turbot with bacon, pepper and poultry juice was fantastique. And i have to say the food here is always warm and the sauces is divine. The desserts was the best ever, we had flambeed cherries with pistacchio ice cream and wild strawberries with meringue and basil sorbet. Probably the most beatiful and delicious desserts ever. The wine selection is also pretty great, we had Didier Dageneau ""Le Mont Damnè"" 2010, Arnaud Ente Meursault 2013 and Fonsalette 2006. Sorry for the long review but got carried away. At last i just wanted to say a big thank you to the whole team and see you soon :) BRAVO!!!!!";mai-18;Epicure
7;best three star in Paris;5.0;We stayed at this hotel for 9 days and this was our BEST meal in Paris. We ate at four Michelin star restaurants during our 9 days, so we had a lot of good meals, but this was the best. Quite formal, but lovely setting and excellent service.;mars-18;Epicure
7;Not worth of 3 stars;3.0;The restaurant has three Michelin stars.I have dined more than 100 times in Michelin starred restaurants including many 3 starred.Epicure is not among the 50 best of them.This is not the first time when I wonder why a restaurant in France gets much easier stars than restaurants in other European countries.We had a 7-course set menu. It took almost 2 hours before we got the first course.We had informed restaurant ahead that two of us can not eat any kind of onions. In the beginning waiters checked who had that special dietary. When we received the second course they had already forgotten that special request. It was burned leak which we had to ask to be changed. Other courses were mostly ok but just ok. Nothing special nor great taste.;avr-18;Epicure
7;Magic;5.0;for me as a sommelier. this Resturante delivers magic. perfekt way of service. amazing food. wine list is superb. it was worth it. probably one of the best resturants in world. Magic. we had the tasting meny pluss the macaronne;mai-18;Epicure
7;Spectacular and delightful!;5.0;Worth the investment of time and money to experience a spectacular three Michelin starred restaurant. From the moment we stepped foot in Le Bristol and were greeted at L’Épicure, the experience was first class. The setting is gorgeous and highlights the most excellent cuisine. If you enjoy multiple courses and tasting menus from the best chefs - go here! The staff are attentive and very knowledgeable. Baptist the sommelier was extremely helpful and recommended the best wine. I’d visit again. Worth every penny!;mai-18;Epicure
7;Beautiful and delicious!;5.0;Amazing meal situated in an enchanting dining room surrounded by a lovely garden court of the classic Bristol Hotel. The service is impeccable from start to finish you are not wanting for anything. A memorable evening. Go for the tasting menu and splurge its worth it!;avr-18;Epicure
7;Fantastic and Faboulous French experience;5.0;Prices are on the high side but worth it if one wants to have a French Gastronomy experience. Has the seafood meal, Fish and Lobster. Deep and intense. Not only the first and main course, cheese and sweets are included. Chocoholics should try the Peru Chocolate Dessert. Staffs are superb and friendly to everyone. Professional attitude.;avr-18;Epicure
7;Ideal restaurant;5.0;This is just an ideal french restaurant. So chic and so french! The chef creates the perfect dishes and we feel like... A queen . Come in family or in couple ... And well dressed .);juil-17;Epicure
7;Spectacular!!!;5.0;I have had the privilege of dining at some amazing restaurants around the world and Epicure is most definitely one of the BEST restaurants I have ever had the pleasure to visit. We arrived early for our dinner reservation and were immediately greeted by an incredibly cheerful and respectful staff. The service levels throughout the dining experience provided by the various waiters and the sommelier were nothing less than perfect throughout the entire meal. The staff was extremely professional without being pretentious (and I have had my fair share of pretentiousness in other fine dining establishments in Paris). The ambience in the dining room was formal yet relaxed. The views of the courtyard and gardens were fantastic. Most importantly, the food was simply out of this world. We chose the tasting menu and when I say that everything was out of this world, I am not exaggerating. From the first course through the last course, we were simply amazed at the presentation and flavor of all the dishes. My compliments and my sincere thanks to the chef and the entire staff for providing us with a phenomenal experience. While this restaurant certainly is extremely expensive (certainly one of the most expensive meals I have had in a while), it is worth every penny and I cannot wait to return.;avr-18;Epicure
7;Birthday Dinner;4.0;The atmosphere was sophisticated yet relaxed. We arrived early for our reservation and our table was ready. The service was very good as was the food. Unfortunately, I have been to other michelin starred restaurants that I have enjoyed better...maybe it's just a matter of personal taste. We ordered the sea urchin (and I have had sea urchin before) and didn't care for it. The staff was more than accommodating in bringing us another appetizer without even being asked which was delicious! The wine the sommelier recommended was excellent! The spacing between courses was perfect. When we got the check, it was very expensive and included a luxury tax which we weren't expecting. Overall, a nice birthday dinner.;avr-18;Epicure
7;Extraordinary.;5.0;This is one of the most wonderful culinary experiences we’ve had. We were greeted by engaged and happy staff who clearly wanted to ensure we had a memorable afternoon. We did. The lunch menu or seasonal menu was brilliant and our sommelier took the time to help navigate the wines to best compliment our choices. An afternoon of wonderful food and a truly extraordinary experience created by a top notch staff!!!;avr-18;Epicure
7;Outstanding!!! THE BEST!!!!!;5.0;Amazing experience at le epicure! Definitely worth the expending! Service is also amazing, the Waitrose were on top of every little detail. I went there with a lot of expectations and definitely beat them! I can only say amazing words of the place, the ambience and the food.... they have a very well deserve 3 stars Michelin!!;avr-18;Epicure
7;Unforgettable !;5.0;I ate with my sister in the Epicure last saturday to celebrate a special occasion. I am 25 years in the restaurant business in Paris but have never experienced such sublime service, attention to detail, coupled with the excellence of the cuisine. We both had the full tasting menu. It was beyond delicious ! . A special thankyou to Frederic Kaiser, Baptiste and all the team for making it an unforgettable 4 hour experience ! Alan D. Paris.;avr-18;Epicure
7;The top;5.0;The top restaurant ever... like a dream and a tasting experience.. to visit at least ince in the life... impossible to forget...;avr-18;Epicure
7;"Epicure Experience ""The best""";5.0;meet a friend here and didn't expect the kind of place is it. It wasn't cheap but hey it's worth the price. I must say as a food enthusiast this is probably one of the BEST EVER EXPERIENCE! Thank you for the nice service and food. Hope to come back really soon.;févr-18;Epicure
7;Simply fabulous;5.0;What can I write? Where to start?Bristol hotel is probably one of the best hotel you can experience in Paris, but Epicure is surely the best restaurant you can book in this wonderful town.The staff is friendly and very professional. Immediately you feel comfortable and you understand that you are about to live through an unforgettable moment.Wine list is just fantastic and the wine keeper advise us in a good way.Menu is great and it's difficult to make its mind.I order stuffed maccaroni with black truffle. It was genuine black truffle from Dordogne and not imported truffle from down under. Therefore, the taste was fantastic and explode in mouth.As main, I had pot-au-feu with black truffle. It was so tasty! It's oxtail with a tasty broth, born marrow, celeriac mousseline and black truffle cut in small cubes. This dish is served in 2 plates. I strongly advise to take this pot-au-feu, as it's for me the best work that a Chef can cook.For dessert, I had Peru chocolate presented in a pod. That was delicious.I have to add that appetizers are fabulous and amazing.Congratulation to the chef Eric Frechon and all his staff in the kitchen and dinner room. I will come back definitely to test and taste the chef menu.To conclude, if you love what's fine and the genuine French cooking book a table at Epicure restaurant it worth it and you won't regret it.;avr-18;Epicure
7;Best dining experience of my life;5.0;Title says it all. Service, atmosphere and food was exquisite. We had lunch which lasted all afternoon. It wasn’t cheap but worth every cent. Will always remember the experience here. HIGHLY recommended!;mai-17;Epicure
7;A lovely Experience;5.0;My wife and I and two friends were lucky enough to visit Epicure last week .The restaurant itself is simply stunning , classically furnished and overlooking Le Bristol’s impressive garden .The moment we entered we were greeted by highly professional yet friendly helpful staff , they weren’t stuffy or pompous which we have unfortunately encountered at some other Michelin restaurants . You just new that you were in for something special .Amuse Bouche , macaroons and sweets added to fantastic starters and mains served impeccably , all made for an exceptional evening . Couldn’t fault a thing it wasn’t the most economical meal I’ve ever had but it was possibly the most memorable and we had 4 magical hours in a lovely setting .They thoroughly deserve their 3 Michelin’s stars , thanks to all concerned .;mars-18;Epicure
7;High quality!;5.0;Beyond the remarkable care service and high quality, eating was a real experience. Perhaps the best food ever in my life.;sept-17;Epicure
7;Excellent;5.0;Hands down, best meal of my life. With three Michelins Stars, Eric fréchon has conquered new heights. The food and service are both exquisite. We dined in the winter restaurant, which is vast and beautiful.;déc-17;Epicure
7;Business Owner;5.0;There are no words. We as a family and as a business travel weekly both in the US and abroad. Eating is not only necessity but pure luxury to us. This dining venue far exceeds the title of “fine dining”. You will experience the complete package of France’s welcoming people to exceptional food and ambiance.;déc-17;Epicure
7;Beautiful lunch^^;5.0;I chose Epicure to celebrate my husband's birthday, reserved two months ago and requested the window seat for pretty garden view.We ordered set lunch and the price was reasonable, great environment and vibe (snowy romance), exceptional staffs and delectable dishes, acquire unforgettable dinning experience at all.;févr-18;Epicure
7;Valentine from hell;1.0;Warning the review may come like a shocker, went there for our anniversary dinner and valentine night Booked and prepaid a month ago for 1300 euro for two ( valentine price factor )I was expecting to have a superb nite All was heading for 4 star nite, reason was some sluggish service by one staff who looked rushed and hyper But as we were in our third main which was veal, intruder enjoyed the dish but my wife complained that her meat was to strange and she shared a piece with me and it was absolutely strange and inedible, called the manager and shared with him the problem, he have asked my wife if she wanted something else, at that time she was full as we opted not to have any replacement, now we are down to three star rating as this you wouldn’t expect for a 3 Michelin star place but all is good Then came the bad slam dunk finish as we asked and re asked for the bill ( for the water , tea ) it took like 10 mins to come with a bill of 76 euro ?!They had a problem with their POS with chip cards and the lady was so rude in the way she handled the problem as i assured her that my cards my working, my wife probably both embarrassed for the situation she got some cash and her prepaid card ( magnetic strip )and paid the bill quickly. And the lady didn’t care who is paying as she was in a rush to get paidAnd in a very snobbish and impolite way she said her cards are working and yours aren’t That was a low low for behavior and manners that they shouldn’t retain their 3 Michelin star for such attitude, the lady doesn’t deserve to work in a restaurant even Thank you for ruining a special nite for me Will never step into your place again, never will recommend it It’s not food , it’s service and ppl who serve you that make the difference.;févr-18;Epicure
7;Good;4.0;Another personal disappointment with a three Michelin stars establishment. Don’t get me wrong, Epicure is a very good restaurant but is that enough to award it three stars? I have been to other restaurants which are more creative and more delicious. What would you award those then?!Let us start with the decor and ambience. The place is classically but beautifully decorated. High ceilings and larger chandeliers. It has a beautiful terrace but it was winter so we could not use that. Warm greetings when we arrived. Polite and efficient service but it was formal and I mean very formal to the extent that you don’t feel comfortable. Even when the plate is picked up the standard question is “how was it”? When you answer thy it was excellent, the response is automatic and formal “that is good to know”! As if that is what is expected. Unfortunately towards the end the service started to fade. My water glass was empty for a while and during the service of two courses. I had to ask for water! Something you would not expect at a three stars establishment. Only then they realized that the Evian bottle was actually empty and they had to bring another one. We had to wait sometime to find someone to ask for the bill and we had to inform them that the credit card is in the bill wallet for them to bring the card machine. Now the food. The food is definitely good and tasty but that’s it. There is no wow factor. And I am not being supercilious. I have been to restaurants in Spain and the Nordic countries where dishes bring out the Wow our of you. The dishes are classic with no much creativity. You will end up asking yourself. it was a good meal but where are the three stars? Would I repeat the experience? Most probably not. As TripAdvisor doesn’t have a “Good” rating I had to give it a “Very Good” as it is definitely not Average;févr-18;Epicure
7;Great;5.0;Very classic three Michelin star restaurant had lunch there in November 2017 with four friends we enjoyed the great service and food. After the meal we saw the kitchens and met the chef I must say it was a great experience and I would certainly recommend this restaurant with great food and great service.;nov-17;Epicure
7;Sumptuous without being stuffy.;5.0;If you are going to have one meal in Paris, this is the place to have it. The knowledgeable sommelier does a fabulous job pairing wines with the food (of course!).;janv-18;Epicure
7;Five, if not six points for the service and the atmosphere, 3 for the food.;4.0;"Disclaimer: I eat vegan only. This restaurant is not yet able to cater to vegans. For the 75th birthday of my dad, we came to the Bristol and after reading about the Épicure, I decided to have dinner here on the day of his birthday. Before dinner, we had breakfast here. Absolutely perfect. This hotel can be happy to have such personell! Incredible! If you stay here, breakfast in the Épicure is a must. Service at dinner was awesome. The people here are smart, friendly, funny and super efficient. We had a table for two at the windows in the middle and felt wonderful. The dinner lasted 4 hours and only in the end, the service suffered a tiny little bit, which did not bother us. Before I will discuss the vegan 7 course dinner in detail, let me tell you that the sommelier did a great job suggesting a white burgundy wine. The Chassagne-Montrachet ""Les Chenevottes"", 2011, J.N. Gagnard made me cry when I first tasted it. This is why certain people go crazy for wine... I had forgotten it again.. Now to the vegan 7 course menu which including the hors-d'oeuvre and the birthday cake ended up being 9 courses in total. I will rate the courses chronologically from one to ten, ten being the best grade. N° 1: Hors d'oeuvre: 9N° 2: first course: 3 in plain french: n'importe quoi! N° 3: 6,5: great natural celery taste, but come on! I expected way more..N° 4: leek in burnt outer layers.. nice idea, quite interesting, taste good, but not really great, therefore: 7N° 5: Main course: artichoke. good. 8N° 6: cheese: no cheese for me, just a nice little salad and some really tasty dried fruit. but again, not what you expect in a restaurant like that, at these prices. N° 7 :first desert: ok. 6N° 8: 2nd desert: great! 9 really nice tasteN° 9: special vegan chocolate b-day cake! Fantastic! Wow! 10! So overall I can really not recommend this place for people who don't eat dead animals. My father is less of a gourmet and he really enjoyed the whole evening and was very impressed with the service as well, but he did not express any special delight concerning the food. Presentation was just average. Apart from the hors-d'oeuvre the eye was not very pleased. Overall we really enjoyed being here and I was really happy with certain dishes, but it was not worth the price and I would have expected much more from the best rated gourmet restaurant on tripadvisor and the restaurant of the otherwise divine hotel Bristol. Again: breakfast was fantastic! Shuts out to Nathanael and everybody else. And please be more strict with people who watch videos without earphones.";janv-18;Epicure
7;Spectacular setting, service and food.;5.0;This is truly one of the best in Europe. The room is not large, but spacious and gracefully appointed. The wait staff is unobtrusive, but never miss. The wine stewards are what you would expect--perfection and so helpful. Tell them your preference and they will give you a couple of choices that are marvelous. Feel free to give them a budget and they will choose something wonderful for you.;oct-17;Epicure
7;Grand French Experience Sur la Table;4.0;We enjoyed a fabulous performance when we ordered the poulet de Bresse for two.( It was just after the world lost Paul Bocuse, so it was particularly appropriate.)The service was spectacular. The chicken was served in two courses: first the breast in cream with fresh truffles, then the giblets and legs in the richest broth ever.We left happy and aware of the rarity of our experience in this busy world!;janv-18;Epicure
7;A meal worth waiting for;5.0;We booked the tasting menu diner 2 months ago . The meal is definitely worth the wait .It took over 4 hours to go through the 7 courses . The artistic presentation and flavors of the dishes all seemed to work together in the most enjoyable way . The service was impeccable , it was like watching a ballet of waiters , close to the borderline of being too much . But this performance is still worthy of 5 stars without a doubt .We ll definitely go back .;janv-18;Epicure
7;Very nice!;5.0;The ambience & environment is very nice. Service is impressive too. We came for lunch and couldn’t believe that we spent 4 hours here. The food was good and I love the cheese too. The macaron cart is amazing!;janv-18;Epicure
7;Top world-class service;4.0;Beyond the remarkable service attentiveness and equipment quality, the food was a real experience. I appreciated every savoury dish, while I was less impressed by the desserts (beautiful presentation too but a bit less balanced in terms of taste). Wines suggestions very appropriate. The decor is very classic and sober, even too much for my taste, but maybe it's the daylight that didn't help creating much atmosphere.;déc-17;Epicure
7;Wonderful;5.0;The service and atmosphere were wonderful. The amuse bouches very inventive. The food was good but not really worth the price. Even though we went for Sunday lunch which should have cost less than dinner. Charming and well trained staff;janv-18;Epicure
7;Our Best Meal Ever;5.0;We were a bit apprehensive about the restaurant since they insisted on jackets, and we thought it might be a stuffy place.The entire dinner experience here was absolutely outstanding - the staff, the food, wine, service, ambience. Was worth every minute and every euro spent there.Will certainly visit again.;déc-17;Epicure
7;Fine dining;4.0;Chose from the set menu. The food was in general very good. The best was the main course. Had possibly higher expectations on the starter and dessert options. The portions were more than adequate so had to leave the chocolates untouched. A great experience with top notch serving but would have given 4.5 stars if it was possible but since it is not, have to keep it as 4.;janv-18;Epicure
7;Very nice place;5.0;Beautiful experience - food, wine, service and location. expensive but then it is one of the best. wonderful food.... irritating bird music cd in the garden - obviously fake!;oct-17;Epicure
7;Speechless;5.0;No words can describe the experience we had.The chef is an artist.The food was coming and you didn't want to eat because of the beauty of the dishes.Ok it's expensive but you know where you are going.Probably the best food ever had in my life.;août-17;Epicure
7;Simply impressive;5.0;If you are in Paris, have the budget, and enjoy French fine dining, this is the experience to go for.Everything from the appetizer to the dessert course was meticulously planned, crafted, explained, and served. Impeccable service (e.g., they will seamlessly fill/refill drinks at the perfect time when you're talking or eating, like a ninja, you won't even notice it happened). Plan 3-4 hours for the dinner tasting menu.You won't be disappointed!;déc-17;Epicure
7;Amazing, possibly the best;5.0;This was our third Christmas lunch in a row at Epicure and once again we had a wonderful experience at this restaurant. It was indeed an ‘amazing’ journey throughout the 3 + at least 3 course dinner! Possibly, one of the best meals we have ever had. The food is magical as it should be in a three star restaurant, with a lot of extras like an additional dish (ravioli from heaven), the pre dessert, the amazing variety of excellent cheeses and the final silver box with goodies among other items ten or so different kinds of the best macarons we have ever tested (I do not normally enjoy macarons that much, but these are macarons to die for). What impressed us besides the food was the incredibly professional waiters, always friendly, warm and funny (especially the head waiter) unlike some stuffy waiters at certain Michelin star restaurants. We love our visits to Epicure and will definitely return next Christmas.;déc-17;Epicure
7;The Best;5.0;We went to this restaurant in early December to celebrate my wife’s birthday. Our children came with us and the restaurant staff were fantastic to them and even had a small gift for them. The food was simply spectacular in every way. The hotel is fantastic and the staff were world class. We had a wonderful evening and this is a special place to go for a special event.;déc-17;Epicure
7;Superb , best of the best;5.0;Elegant , classic decor , lovely view of the hotel gardens . Impreccable service , cuisine , and wine list . Expensive , but the dining experience here - unsurpassable ( and worth every euro ).;juil-17;Epicure
7;It was good, but not amazing;5.0;"It's hard to write this review.There was nothing wrong with the dinner and the whole experience.Service was attentive, friendly and prompt. Throughout my 3 hour dinner I admired at the army of waiting staff who worked the room with military precision. I thought it was very impressive.The setting was very warm and comfortable. Not over the top luxurious, just overlooking a nice courtyard/garden with a roaring fireplace in the background.The food was nice. We appreciated the amuse bouche, dessert offerings. We both had the delicious sea urchin as appetizer, and I had lamb as main (incredibly soft and divine) while my wife had scallops with white truffle (I thought it was rather bland, probably because my lamb was much stronger in taste).But given this is Epicure, not just Michelin 3-star but also often cited as the best restaurant in Paris, the capital of fine dining, we were hoping there would be more ""wow"" moments. It was certainly an enjoyable evening, but I won't list it as a particularly memorable dinner.";déc-17;Epicure
7;Best Restaurant in the World;5.0;This is simply the best restaurant in the world. The food was delicious and the service was amazing, big thank you to Alicia, Dalphine and Vincent for making our afternoon special. We both loved it ❤️❤️❤️;déc-17;Epicure
7;an edible theatrical production.;5.0;This was certainly an unforgetbale experience. We were the last to arrive and the last to leave, we were made to feel welcome, relaxed and important. The surroundings are ornate and grand, the service professional, freindly and fun. The food excellent.;mai-17;Epicure
7;The last romantic in french cousin;5.0;The words cannot describe my experience. It was 3 of us. We had lunch for almost 4 hours. The food was so good that if I could cry in public I would. Every dish was special , with exceptional presentation, the color , the smell was so exciting. Not everything was to my liking (for example i did not like the fish souse) but there was not one dish I had to skip. Desert like i never seen before! Atmosphere was relaxing despite it being one of the most expensive places in Paris. I paid more then 1000$ the best money I ever spend in the restaurant. I hope to visit it again when I am in Paris.;juin-17;Epicure
7;ok meal, excellent service. did not feel like it was even close to worth it;2.0;Let me preface this review by saying that I have been to other 3 star Michelin restaurants like French Laundry. Epicure was just ok. My girlfriend and I had the tasting menu, she had 2 glasses of rose, 1 glass of wine. Total bill came to $961 US.When spending that much, I would expect the food to be amazing, and it fell well short. The service was great, but that was the only really nice experience at Epicure. It felt like a $300-$400 experience at most, and only the service saved them.My girlfriend and I were horribly disappointed. I would save your hard earned $$$ and get reservations at Les Papilles and have $800 left over.;déc-17;Epicure
7;Amazing experience;5.0;We have been to dinner on the 9th Dec. This has been by far the most memorable meal of my life. Having been to numerous Michelin starred restaurants I had high expectations but these were surpassed beyond my expectations. Food is simply devine. Impeccable service. Wine pairings perfect. Cheese selection awesome. Dessert simply to die for. I would fly back to Paris just for one day to have dinner again.;déc-17;Epicure
7;Perfect;5.0;Great meal. Macaroni to die for. Was a welcome rebound after a poor meal at Guy Savoy the night before. Would recommend.;oct-17;Epicure
7;Epic Dining Experience!;5.0;Epicure is simply an incredible dining experience. I say that after spending a week in Paris and having my fair share of fine dining throughout the city. I surprised my wife for her birthday and she was very pleased. I recommend making a reservation a week or 2 in advance. I did so via email. They confirmed the reservation by calling me in the US from Paris. The food was meticulously prepared and all was delicious. We each had the 6 course tasting menu. A great variety of seafood, duck, pasta....etc. Each and every course impressed us.The service was excellent as well. The wait staff and sommelier were very friendly and helped us choose a number of excellent wines that we simply loved. I've been to high-end restaurants before and I find that the staff is sometimes very uptight and stuffy. Not here, the people who work at Epicure were very pleasant and at times funny.This restaurant is inside the Le Bristol Hotel which is a gorgeous establishment. Epicure is very warm (fireplace was roaring) and classy. It has a nice and cozy feel and when you dine there you will feel important.Well Done.;nov-17;Epicure
7;So much more than a three-star restaurant;5.0;Paris of course boasts a number of the world’s top restaurants and chefs. The Epicure however is more than one of the world’s leading restaurants and Eric Frechon, more than one of the world’s top chefs.Like any three-star restaurant, the service is of course impeccable. But the quality of this restaurant goes beyond the perfection one expects from a three-star restaurant. Beyond the Bristol’s sumptuous setting as a Paris institution, its gastronomic excellence and the irreproachable quality of its service, it also stands apart by offering something perhaps even grander: the art of hospitality, exemplified by the chef’s generosity of spirit and capacity to convey and share his passion for his art. Thank you Chef and the staff of Epicure for offering me a delightful interlude and a wonderful lunch last Friday, making my short trip to Paris more than worthwhile. I’ll be looking forward to my next visit. T.JUDGE, Limoux;nov-17;Epicure
7;To eat here is life-changing!;5.0;One must make a reservation which I did via email. If you can get a window seat then there is an amazing view of the beautiful garden.Being of asian origin and english speaking, I was hesitant at first having experienced occasion discrimination, but the staff at this restaurant were kind and helpful.They created such a relaxing and enjoyable environment. Especially Stephan.I came here with my dad for lunch and we had the tasting menu. They add 2 pre-appetizers and a pre-dessert. The seafood tasting menu was outstanding with clear flavours, fresh and novel ingredients and no theatrics.The amount of food with all the extra courses is more than enough.The service was very attentive, friendly but not overly done.The sommelier advised a nice bordeaux without breaking the budget of Euro 190. It complemented the food well.The dessert of lychee sorbet with edible rose petals was divine.We also had the cheese- dont miss the Brillat-Saverin cheese!Then comes the Macaron pushcart with so many flavours.The coffee selection was good and we went with the standard jamaican. I would not recommend driving as it will be difficult after the fullness of the menu and drinks.As the meal takes 2-3 hours, it would be difficult for young children to stay attentive.Afterwards, take a slow stroll around the beautiful hotel and marvel at the interiors.Our wait staff Stephan was impeccable and helpful.I will always remember this meal.;nov-17;Epicure
7;Incredible!;5.0;Impeccable service inside the Bristol hotel.The food is amazing and incredibly beautiful. After dessert they bring a cart with sweets to chose from !Atmospheric is nice and cozy .It's such an amazing experience!Prices around 300 euro per person;nov-17;Epicure
7;Perfect place!!;5.0;First to arrive was a trio of appetisers. There was a delicious green asparagus puree, lightly seasoned with mint, topped with a white asparagus cream (veloute-like), and garnished with mushrooms and baby croutons. Equally lovely was a puff filled with foie gras and smoked eel, coated with raspberry and a crayfish coated with a Tandoori crème, sandwiched between mini prawn crackers. The appetisers were accompanied by a savoury chorizo, bacon and olive Kugelhopf. Shortly after we were presented with an absolutely stunning basket of house-baked breads, of which the pointy white baguettes were particularly impressive.;déc-16;Epicure
7;Simply sublime;5.0;From start to finish it was an experience. The attention to detail is immaculate. The food is delicious - I had the langostine followed by the scallops and the honey and lemon dessert. The dessert was the most surprising - but so incredibly delicious. The price tag was hefty but as you would expect for a 3 michelin starred restaurant.;nov-17;Epicure
7;Perfect;5.0;Amazing serving of food. It is real art and it tastes very well too. The ingredients are fresh and atmosphere is very friendly and relaxed.;juin-17;Epicure
7;Fantastic Epicure.;5.0;No where better to dine than here. Food, service and ambience are the best. Amazing tasting menu. Best deserts in the world. Fantastic wine list. Yes a big bill but worth every penny and worthy of its three stars. Consistently stunning.;août-17;Epicure
7;Perfect;5.0;Simply perfect. Luxurious hotel that harbours this great french institution by now. Wonderful premises, the restaurant faces a wonderful inside garden, but is decorated with taste, sophistication and refinement. As for the staff, we arrived at the reception desk of the hotel. The staff simply guided us, personnaly, to the restarurant reception. How great! There, efficient to perfection, courteous, helpful, everyone maskes their best. As for the food, wow! Chef Eric Frechon is simply a genius! Inventive, delicate, tasteful, from bread to dessert and after dessert. Looking forward to coming back. Bravo!;nov-17;Epicure
7;Just What the Reviews Suggest;5.0;Had a dinner at Epicure and it was fantastic. Testing menu which we did not alter, but they would if needed. We also ordered the wine pairing which we also enjoyed. Nicest and hard working service, great preparation and gorgeous presentation. The price was reasonable for this type of dinner. The service was extremely discreet and exactly what you'd expect from a top class restaurant. Looking forward to visiting epicure for another delicious meal the next time we're in Paris.;oct-17;Epicure
7;A warm welcome to Fine dining;5.0;Some Michelin start restaurants are daunting for those like us, who only go there on very special occasions. Not the Epicure. From the moment you enter you are made to feel so welcome. We had to cancel 2 from our table as our daughter was taken into hospital that day to have our first grandchild. it was not a problem and the staff were very supportive and excited for us. So much so we were given a gift for the baby. The food , course after course, was exceptional, The sommeliers were knowledgeable and helpful, they chose wines for us that were perfect and not the most expensive either!! We can speak a little French but The staff spoke perfect English and in an unpatronizing manner. This was our 40th wedding anniversary day and we couldn't have chosen a better way to celebrate it. Delphina and Julia deserve a special mention as they are staff that take the service above and beyond fine dining, and make it truly memorable. Many thanks to them and everyone at the Epicure, we hope to come back for our next celebration.;nov-17;Epicure
7;much better dinner;5.0;everything was perfect...the price was high but worth the cost ...you get what you pay for!!! the service was perfect !!!! we hope to return soon;oct-17;Epicure
7;Our second visit - and splurge;5.0;Our first visit was a couple of years ago - we enjoyed the tasting menu the first time, but this time opted for a la carte. The meal was delicious - and the service largely spectacular. We did feel we waited longer than we should have, but what we realized was that the table that ordered the tasting menu seemed to be the priority of the kitchen. And of course that makes sense when you have so many coursed to serve. Be sure to allow ample time - and not be in a hurry as many of us American's are!;oct-17;Epicure
7;Perfect;5.0;Perfect - wine, food, service, settingWent for the seasonal lunch menu and enjoyed every dish. The recommendedlol wine was the best we had in our week in Paris (and affordable!).;oct-17;Epicure

7;Wish I Could Give More Stars;5.0;Went here for dinner while in Paris. This was going to be our big splurge. We each ordered a starter and an entrée and I was worried that we were going to leave hungry. Boy was I wrong. First they brought out a cheese plate for each of us and they kept bringing out food, until I couldn't eat anymore. I passed on the beautiful cabinet full of cookies that they rolled to the table. Next thing I know they had packed a box of cookies for me to take home. The service was beyond anything I had ever seen, the food was incredible, but the wine was the best of all, and I used to live near Napa. We sat looking out at the patio, which is perfectly landscaped. This restaurant deserves its Michelin rating.;sept-17;Epicure
7;Amazing;5.0;One of the best meals ever.If you are in Paris, you have to try.The food is perfect and the service very friendly.Higly recommended.;oct-17;Epicure
7;Unique experience;5.0;A unique experience. The food is outstanding. I tried the duck breast and the tiny chunks of marinated eel in a raspberry jelly. both were delicious. The service was amazing and extremely kind and helpful. Strongly recommended.;mai-17;Epicure
7;Best meal in Paris!!;5.0;Amazing experience with outstanding food and service! The restaurant is beautiful in the lovely hotel Le Bristol. From the very beginning, the staff was so warm and friendly and the service absolutely outstanding! The food was incredible - fresh delicate flavors, beautifully presented. Exactly the kind of experience one would expect from a 3 star restauran;oct-17;Epicure
7;"Always The best in Paris since two decades ( since La Verrière ) , Despite the "" Junta "" outside !";5.0;"Dining at EPICURE is like Dining at La Verrière in the Mid Nineties : forgetting how Paris became now and going back to Mitterand 's Era when it was still the city of light ..... and best food and service . All was perfect last weekend at Epicure . Duck breast was excellent and the veal bread delicious . You would also never be disappointed by the Bordeaux list . With less than five hundred euros for a couple ( more reasonable than many restaurants in Geneva , but of course not with the same feeling of security as when in Switzerland ) : When you feel yourself to be in critical condition, you must treat yourself at EPICURE . Believe me , here at least , also waiters are as gentle as in Switzerland and witty as in Rome . So forget the outside world in Paris and go twice a year for a short weekend to Paris and dine at EPICURE . We only regret not to have stayed at Le Bristol instead of Hôtel Plaza Athénée , even if it was for just one night ( enough , when the center of Paris look like Buenos Aires or Santiago de Chili at the time of the junta of last century ! ) Little tip or a piece of advise and a hint : i will not disclose the name of the Bordeaux that made me forget , that day , the words of the "" little jesuit student made President "" who , ignorantly or willingly , dared to criticize the people of Catalonia trying with bare hands to defend their women and children and Country against the savagery of the armed Franquists : just mention my "" latter sentence "" and the sommelier will know what wine i choose !";oct-17;Epicure
7;Amazing experience;5.0;There are only 10 three Michelin star restaurants in Paris. This was quite simply a wonderful experience. The service was fantastic, helpful and inclusive, never intimidating.;oct-17;Epicure
7;Wonderfulle dinner;5.0;Perfect is the only way to describe this restaurant and the experience you have when dining there.Came back for dinner after 4 years. Food was and still is up at the very best, specially the chicken we had that was cooked in pigs bladder was one of the best things I have ever eaten. everything was delicious and service was perfect.well deserve all the superlative and reputation!;sept-17;Epicure
7;The poetry of the impossible;5.0;Dante is said to be the poet of the impossible and its master piece “La Divina Commedia”.At L’Epicure there is another poet of the impossible: Eric Fréchon. Every dish he creates, stolen from the realm of the unattainable, is a “piatto divino”.Genius is in the details. At L’Epicure, all are considered, weighted and chiseled to perfection. Décor is welcoming thanks to a munificence restrained by good taste. Plenty of natural light comes through many french windows leading to the hotel’s enclosed garden, a manicured cloister garden in Paris, ultimate luxury. Very French.Dinnerware is deceptively simple so as not to distract you from the impossible delights they will frame. Still if you pay attention, you will notice how sophisticated the bone china plates are with their white on white patterns and etchings. Waiters have that elusive quality of attending to your needs before you notice them yourselves as if all had been at your service for years and years. They materialise exactly just the moment before you would realise you were about to wish their assistance. The “being always there” without being present.What could increase your sense of privilege, well being and happiness?The food. What an ugly word for the astonishing wonderment of your palate!How to describe the fireworks of surprises that my replete belly and my blasé appetite despaired to experience ever again?What about the tiny chunks of marinated eel in a raspberry jelly ? I hate eel and I could have cried to get another spoonful. It came. Is there a telepath in the brigade?What about the Sole Petit bateau? How many had I already tasted? But this diamond all covered in a glazed foam belonged to the realm of the unreal. Who had not been pestered by fishbone, but the ones caramelised and crushed and hidden in a razor thin layer in the Sole diamond added that necessary crunchy feeling , a stroke of genius. Who could sing the perfect freshness of the accompanying baby girolle mushrooms with just the right amount of chiselled parsley to enhance even further their sinful perfection?Desert. The fist one was a chef d’oeuvre of trompe l’oeil : a yellow lemon with its green leaf sculpted in sugar. Cut in two the lemon displayed every strata of an actual lemon except that each layer was made of the most delicious pastry, meringue à l’italienne and small cubes of the rarest and sweetest lemon of all, the lemon from Menton (South of France near Monaco)As I said those being at your service know you better than yourselves.I got a second desert. Looking like an egg laid by the golden goose in a shrine of dark chocolate, it proved to be a knock out. Imagine a spoonful of chocolate mousse that does not dissolve in your mouth but vanishes to expire its soul, the soul of chocolate. A physicist calls this phenomenon of a solid going straight to a gaseous state without being liquid in between: sublimation.How right. Sublime, indeed.Between and before every dish you get some sort of clever little chunks of this or that. Food you would never order because they are outlandish, just outlandishly tasty.The last unknown comes to you in an all silver all mirror curiosity cabinet. When it is opened for you, lo and behold, jewels of … Well I do not want to spoil it for you.The sommelier knows his art. We got the right champagne, the right white burgundy.For my American readers from Texas, yes it is refreshingly expensive, very refreshingly expensive.;sept-17;Epicure
7;The best food of my life;5.0;"We went to Paris and decided we were going to go to one ""fancy"" restaurant while there. We choose Epicure based on reviews and it did not disappoint!! It was the best food experience we've ever had!! From the food to the service and atmosphere!! We did the tasting menu and while it wasn't cheep (€345 for both of us), it was totally worth it! Keep in mind, guys must wear a suit coat! We will definitely splurge here again!";août-17;Epicure
7;One of the best dining experiences cross the globe;5.0;"I am a vegetarian and had great difficulty at time when traveling to a place where a vast population prefers non-vegetarian food. At Epicure, the chefs specially designed a ""vegetarian tasting menu"" for me and it was amazingly delicious. They not just cared for what kinds of tastes I have, but also made sure that each following dish is closer to my liking than before. They have great sense of food and taste. I will never forget my dinner there. The service also is great and so is the ambiance.";avr-17;Epicure
7;Great dining experience!;5.0;My husband and I came here for our anniversary. We got the three course for 145. You definitely get very full especially with all the amuse Bouche and dessert cart at the end. The highlight was the frosted tomato, veal bread and the dessert cart! It took a while when we first sat down to get the attention from the servers. But that's probably because they were really busy - so understandable. Nevertheless, it was a great dining experience!!;sept-17;Epicure
7;A true dinning experience;5.0;"We ate here in early September, we had a lovey table for 2 , The dinning room is lovely and service is excellent with out being so over stuffy, maybe I mean stiff. Everything was presented with excellence, Grace and style. As one course was being taken away and our eyes looked away my napkin was whisked off my lap [ white] I had on black pants and replaced with a black one so very discreetly[ as you expect in a top top restaurant!] The staff was not stiff, because I can not drink I ordered a coke light and it was presented with a napkin around it.. we joked with a laugh asking.... what year it was, and we all had a good laugh over the 14 dollar coke, { we had no problem with the price} as everything else was"" Top Shelf"" I had the duck breast[ excellent} and My husband had the sweet breads, Mine was delicious but I must say his sweet breads were spectacular!! I have NOTHING negative to say it was worth every penny of the 700 plus dollars For dessert I had the chocolate with the sorbet covered in Gold leaf...........Just an amazing presentation !!. This was a 3 hour wonderful experience and memory with amazing food and service , I would say the best in Paris!! We bought the book to bring home as a Memorial . If you can afford it...GO!! Elegance, and amazing food worthy of the Michelin stars it has earned ..well done!! Merci Epicure and staff ......... and thank you for a most memorable evening in Paris!!";sept-17;Epicure
7;The best----top top;5.0;This was an amazing experience w phenomenal food and a well trained staff. It is inside the Bristol hotel. We had the pine nut morel appetizer dish which is a mushroom dish which was delicious as well as the artichoke dish which was AMAZING.All dishes look great and taste better. We continued with the sole and the red mullet. Both were excellent. The cocoa dessert was insane. Complementary dishes r brought throughout the meal. All excellent. We r stuffed at this point...which is their queue to bring a rolling closet of chocolate and sugar complementary confections. All delicious.If u r interested in a fine dining experience and planning on spending some cash---this is the place to go. It will not disappoint and the staff will contribute immensely to the overall experience.;sept-17;Epicure
7;Best freNCI food in Paris;5.0;The food and the ambience is amazing. Friendly staff but a bit expensive. A small 25 Gas of caviar can cost 150 Euro..;sept-17;Epicure
7;Ten Stars!!!!!;5.0;BEST in Paris. The service is spot-on, the food is creative and absolutely delicious, every single course. The hotel and restaurant are beautiful, warm and welcoming.

7;Delicious food and excellent service;5.0;We were staying at the hotel and did not expect the restaurant to be that good, it was a pleasant surprise.Perfect service, great food, well presented . I absolutely recommend the Epicure if you are going to Paris. It's a little bit on the expensive side, but worth it in my opinion.;févr-17;Epicure
7;Nice but not outstanding;3.0;We were in the Restaurant and also guests in the hotel end of august. We had a table on the terrace which is very nice because there only a few 3 stars restaurants with a terrace. The service was very friendly and professional. We had the tasting menu. To shut it short: the menu was - except the duck as a main course - very good. But not 3 stars. The duck was very chewy. When we told that they offered us another main course we didn't take. Overall nice and good but not a 3 stars rating in our opinion. A little bit disapointing. We expected more.;août-17;Epicure
7;Best Restaurant in Paris;5.0;What a wonderful Restaurant and lovely Service. Great Food . Thoroughly recommend the Epicure Restaurant. Bit expensive but worth every cent. A must Restaurant if you are visiting Paris.;juin-17;Epicure
7;Beautiful and Delicious;5.0;Epicure exceeded our expectations at our family's dinner in Paris. The most outstanding staff in the world, without question. The manager greeted us warmly on arrival. Our waiters were extremely poised, friendly, kind and professional. We thoroughly enjoyed our head waiter, I am sorry to have forgotten to get his name, but who was very tall and slim. He is one of the finest people to ever wait on me or my family. As each of my family members would say, he deserves a raise in pay. Empathetic and warm, let me just say that he and his female colleague were beyond excellent during the course of our dinner. The restaurant is beautiful and I have not even gotten to the cuisine yet. The food was magnificent. Each person's meal was fantastic. Epicure made my children feels welcome and were more than accommodating to our gluten intolerance, bringing us freshly baked gluten-free bread. We did let the restaurant know ahead of time about our allergies. Thank you Epicure for your kind and professional service, and the amazing cuisine we had the privilege of enjoying. Bravo!;août-17;Epicure
7;The pinnacle of French food;5.0;Epicure is famed as the high temple of French food in Paris and the experience is amazing. The food is some of the most refined traditional French could have and the service is excellent. Just the right balance of polite efficiency and information on the various dishes.They also have the most amazing desserts and macaroons so make sure you save the space! Bookings are tricky so plan well ahead and this was probably the most expensive meal on my trip. Worth it for the experience but from a value point, there are other better options (like Kei) if budgets or time is an issue;juin-17;Epicure
7;Wonderful!;5.0;Absolutely wonderful! Food was delightful and the service was superb. We ordered one of the main courses wrongly and they still served us another dish at no additional charge. I was very impressed with the service. Would return again.;août-17;Epicure
7;France at its best;5.0;"Last minute chance during a one day unexpected stopover in Paris. Staff on the phone was able to book us a last minute table for lunch but was clear about the jacket dresscode for gents. We were lucky it was a pleasant day and were able to enjoy outside table (facing guests at the 'simplier' restaurant ""Jardin du Bristol"") and somehow more relaxed dresscode. With the amount of PR the chef collected in recent years, you arrive with high expectations but food was great (avoiding over-sophistication). Truly excepional service - esp. Julie - made us wish everyone could be given a chance to experience once this before returning home, leaving France with the right last(ing) impression...";août-17;Epicure
7;Ubelievable;5.0;"One of my ""bucket list"" items has always been to eat at a Michelin 3 Star restaurant in Paris. I have always considered that my ""ultimate"" culinary goal. I finally had a chance on my honeymoon and after much research and advice chose Epicure. I could not have made a better selection. I have often heard it said that the difference between a 1 star and a 3 star restaurant is attention to detail. Epicure got every detail perfect. The staff was incredible and struck just the correct balance between being professional and overly friendly. When I asked for a substitution on the Prixe-Fix menu not only was it made happily but they offered to rearrange the courses for a better experience. The recommendations from the Sommelier were spot on, I thought they hit a very reasonable price point for a restaurant of this caliber. Every dish was an incredible tasting experience. Chef Eric Frechon more than lives up to his reputation.";juin-17;Epicure
7;Great experience;5.0;Great experience to the one and only one Bristol gastronomic restaurant awarded 3* Michelin in Paris;août-17;Epicure
7;5 stars full;5.0;Amazing place and service! The waiters are really carefull abour your dishes and chef must be very experiences..i been there with my boyfriend and were super happy! Maybe a bit too expencive but in Paris the prices are higher the average in Europe. Will recommend;août-17;Epicure
7;Best French cuisine;5.0;Beautiful setting in which to enjoy the superb cuisine of chef Eric and what a treat to meet him as well.;janv-17;Epicure
7;Amazing meal and experience;5.0;I always wanted to eat at a Michelin 3 star restaurant and so expectations were very high. The experience did not disappoint as it was amazing from the moment we arrived to when we left. Every detail was attended to and the food was fantastic. The highlights were the duck and the stuffed macroni.;août-17;Epicure
7;A truly magnificent experience. Pure joy.;5.0;This month, to celebrate my wonderful mother turning 80, we organised a rare family gathering at Epicure. The food, wine, service and setting could not have been better. It was, quite literally, the perfect place for a 'foody' family to celebrate a landmark birthday in a sumptuous but relaxed atmosphere. We all chose the full degustation menu which was exceptional. Every course was sublime. Amazing flavours and sensations each delightfully presented. We savoured each mouthful and eagerly awaited each new course. The service was flawless. Literally. The staff were hugely attentive without being fussy or 'hovering'. They enjoyed sharing their knowledge about each course and the delicacies we were about to enjoy. Our needs were anticipated and nothing was too much trouble. All spoke perfect English and were gracious with our variable attempts in French. We enjoyed the performance and choreography when each course arrived and think they did too. (If any of them read this then thank you - you were wonderful!)This is my second amazing lunch at Epicure. I am already looking forward to going back for my third. Thank you for the incredible experience Epicure!;juil-17;Epicure
7;THE Best Restaurant in Paris that deserves to be number 1!;5.0;This was my 3rd visit to Epicure and again it was fantastic... all the way from booking the day before to departing with our special bags of chocolates and macarons! The staff go out of their way to serve you. On arrival we were asked if we would like to sit inside or outside as the day was sunny and beautiful so we chose to sit outside. The food is spectacular and every dish was a work of art with flavours that just were amazing. We had the set summer menu @145 euros each, with 2 choices each of entree, main course and dessert. They spoil you with extra little treats throughout the meal. Congratulations to 3 Michelin Star Head Chef Eric Frechon and his team for providing another outstanding meal.You must eat here and experience the works of art that are created then served by the welcoming, friendly sevice team.;juil-17;Epicure
7;Great service. Beautiful setting. Average food.;4.0;I wouldn't come here again. The service is great, and our table outside was very nice. But the food simply wasn't exceptional, and it wasn't worth the price. Better food can be had at small sidewalk bistros for much less money.;juil-17;Epicure
7;Best dining experience we've ever had;5.0;This was by far the best dining experience my husband and I have ever experienced. The food, the ambiance and the service are absolutely amazing! Truly what I would expect from a Michelin 3 star restaurant. We enjoyed the tasting menu which had us sampling 8 different courses. The skillfulness and artistry of the dishes was such a pleasure to savor. One of our desserts was fashioned out of chocolate to look like a cacao pod-unbelievable! Our servers were top-notch from Fabrice to Bernard the sommelier whose recommendations were excellent. I even got to enjoy a 1975 grand champagne cognac which was exquisite. Our whole lunch experience lasted close to 4 hours and we savored every bit of it! We are looking forward to our next visit.;juin-17;Epicure
7;Amazing Food and Amazing Staff!;5.0;What a GREAT experience, but at a little over $1000.00 for two it should be! The food was truly inspired and the staff was beyond professional. Although young, everyone from the sommelier to the servers were impeccable!;juin-17;Epicure
7;Third Visit and Still Superb;5.0;Probably our favourite restaurant. Maybe its to do with Paris or maybe its due to the beautifully presented food and formal but friendly service. Could also be partly due to the most comprehensive wine list. Whatever it is, it all comes together in this light and airy dining room overlooking a central courtyard garden. The amuse bouche never fail to amaze me and gets everything off to a great start. From here on flavours and dish construction is stunning. You have to leave room for the fantastic deserts too. A visit here is a very special experience. On this one we had a look round the kitchens which were immaculate.;juin-17;Epicure
7;Wonderful 3 hour lunch;5.0;You cannot surpass this experience anywhere in the world. Fantastic service, sublime haute cuisine, more food than anyone could possibly consume and while expensive it is understandable for what you are offered. It's like going to the French Laundry in Napa- you have to experience it at least once if your budget can justify it. The courses are exquisite and works of art. If you want the best meal of your life in an unhurried rarified atmosphere that is not intimidating treat yourself to this experience.;juin-17;Epicure
7;The best in Paris;5.0;Is located in the Bristol hotel very nice place to eat ask for the chef tasting menu is the best. Every little detail they will help because the service and the food are amazing;août-16;Epicure
7;Tradition and Passion;5.0;If someone is carrying the torch of traditional French Food proudly in Paris then it is Eric Frechon at Epicure. No molecular or chemical experiments here. True and full blooded French old school food with full flavour. Loads of lovely flavours from high quality ingredients and not counting or making any exception for calorie counters. Perfect presentation. Fantasic service and ofcourse the precise and tasty wine matching. if required by the glass. of high-end wines is a pleasure. Full Points from me. 100 out of 100;juil-17;Epicure
7;5 star Michelin;5.0;My husband and I had the pleasure of dining at Epicure for the second time. I must say we were simply blown away with the service and food. The caviar and the macaroni were supremely satiating. The star of the night was the chicken for 2. This dish is not to be underestimated. It's the most tender and delicious chicken you would ever had had. The cherry and chocolate desert were both outstanding. What was even better was the service. Totally and completely worth all the stars possible. Attentive and humorous. Kudos to Remi and his team. We loved our meal and Epicure and hope to make it back to Paris for it again.;juil-17;Epicure
7;Wonderful cuisine;4.0;Wonderful cuisine and ambiance. Nice crowd. Great place for family and friends to enjoy an evening together. Wait expected on weekends. Advisable to book in advance;juin-17;Epicure
7;Perfect moment;5.0;This restaurant is located in Le Bristol Hotel Paris. Everything was perfect. The ambience was great and there's a beautiful garden to enjoy. The service was very friendly and everyone is treated like a special guest. The food was obviously top-notch. I was very full so skipped dessert and cheese course. The price was expensive but it's totally worth to try!;juin-17;Epicure
7;Best of the Best;5.0;This was my husband's and my first three Michelin star restaurant and it was well worth the money for the experience. Inventive cuisine with impeccable service. If this is your first foray into modern French cuisine, you couldn't pick a better place. Note though that we had lunch, which was around $500 for the two of us, as we had wine with the meal. Dinner will likely run around $900 for two if the couple is also drinking.;juin-17;Epicure
7;Perfection;5.0;This will simply be one of the most perfect dining experiences of your life. You will never experience better service. Outdoor seating on a nice evening is otherworldly. Of course, also one of the most expensive meals you will ever have (don't ask), but SO worth it.;juin-17;Epicure
7;Perfection!;4.0;I heard many many wonderful comments about this place from my traveler friends, and I simply had to come and experience dinner here. Place is absolutely amazing, food, service are very good on high standard, especially what I liked was Wine selection! only thing that I was not sure about was 3*.overall a place worth to visit and have a wonderful time!;mai-17;Epicure
7;Totally satisfied;4.0;well.. It seems I dont have to say that this decent restaurant is good. Epicure is deserved to receive the 3*. I will point out that the google map information is somewhat wrong. I couldnt find the restaurant when I type just Epicure in search bar of google map app. Probably you'd better need to add the Bristol Hotel.Food is good. You might see that every clients order seasonal menu for lunch. (I couldnt see exception.:)) But you need to consider ordering foods carefully. Even though the menu price is 150~. You will pay more then 200 euros per person.Dress code is firmly keeped. I wore shirts and formal dress pants. But Epicure requires you wear jacket too. (Usually they rent the dress);juin-17;Epicure
7;classical;5.0;Classical light room largely opened on a garden flowered and sported. But the season does not yet allow lunch on the terrace. Celebrity delighted to be greeted. Service remarkable. No waiting or eagerness between the dishes.;avr-17;Epicure
7;ANOTHER PERFECT MEAL !!!!!!;5.0;WOW, perfection again !!!! From making the reservation to arrival to departure and of course everything in between ! The ambiance is still wonderful, the service impeccable and the food perfectly prepared and executed. The champagne and wine suggestions were excellent as well !! WELL DONE !!! Can't wait to return next year !;juin-17;Epicure
7;Disappointing. Some great food, but overwhelmingly salty ... with jerky, Marx Bros. service;3.0;We visited Epicure in May, 2017, having visited the restaurant 3 years previously when we had a stellar lunch. We were looking forward to a return visit.This time, it was different. We came for lunch and chose the 'Market Menu' which is basically 3 courses, plus a cheese course. Things got off the a bad start when a staff member, intercepting us in the lobby said 'Oh you will be wanting the Brasserie' and seemed surprised (and in retrospect, not so surprised, that we were on a return visit to Epicure. Come on.... We arrived at the restaurant, were seated and given menus. The male member of our group was given the menu with prices. How medieval! The female member was paying. Get with the program, people. We are in 2017 and women can and do pay. So far, so goodish. We chose the 'Sand Carrot' and the sardines to start.The Sand Carrot was a masterpiece of delusion. It was basically a stuffed carrot. Not completely, 'stuffed' because it was quite pleasant to eat. What was the point? and more to the point, how on earth can anyone charge that amount of money for a stuffed carrot??? Oh, we get it, the 'excel spreadsheet' raises its ugly head in a restaurant again. The sardines were o.k, ` a bit pungent and the sauce which accompanied them was similarly pungent. Hmm, ok, but nothing to write home about.For the main course we both ordered sole stuffed with mussels. Oh, wow, this just tasted of salt, intensified. The delicate flavour of the sole was completed 'nuked' by the incredibly salty and buttery sauce - a reduction of the mussel juice or maybe just seawater. It was so salty it hurt.The cheese trolley followed. That was excellent The desserts? One of us chose a strawberry and cream concoction which was delicious and the other, a chocolate and hazelnut number which was too dense and rich.We then asked for the bill and tried to escape. We were delayed by the sweets trolley which featured macrons etc. Very nice. but we had had enough by then.The service? Well, it ranged from excellent to 'Marx Bros' where people were tripping over and crashing into each other. There are too many people working in this place. They all need a choreographer who maybe can tone down the overly theatrical 'lifting of the food covers' which was just silly. And, at the price of the wines we drank, we really resented the fact that the wine glasses were snatched away before we had finished. Noooooo. Don't do this.When the senior wait person asked 'if everything was good for you?'. We said 'no' and told him why. He asked us if we wanted to tour the kitchen. Of course we did.So this is how we ended up meeting the chef, Eric Frechon who seemed genuinely interested in our feedback and explained how he made the sole and mussel dish. We appreciated this explanation, but still found the end result to be unpleasantly salty. Salt is a very strong flavour. In an effort to make up for our disappointment, the chef offered us a complimentary glass of champagne. A charming gesture which we appreciated immensely. We got an eye-wateringly expensive bill at the end of this. We were shocked and embarrassed and you will forgive us if we don't reveal the final total. We noted the E12 per bottle of mineral water. That is just wrong. We felt that the whole experience was just not worth that amount of money. For that amount of money, one expects and should get perfection. How disappointing!!! We are sorry, but we won't be back. This will probably bar us from going back to order the famous 'chicken for 2 in a bladder' but at E270 (and don't forget that expensive mineral water) that will be unlikely.;juin-17;Epicure
7;Unquestionably 3*;5.0;People have ummed and ah'ed about whether or not this is 3* Michelin dining. It is. No ifs or buts. From the room to the menu to the wine list, to the service to the food, this is a restaurant at the very top of its game, with a lively compliment of slightly cheeky staff, I would have absolutely no hesitation in recommending this place and I can't wait to go back. I will only say of the food that the langoustine with mango is one of the best dishes I have ever tried.;juin-17;Epicure
7;Not sure if it is a 3* but definitely a great restaurant;5.0;It was surprising to know that most of the fine dining restaurants in Paris are closed in weekend. I tried to book le Cinq but it was already fully booked 2 months advance. With the few choices left, I chose Epicure at le Bristol. The setting of the restaurant is rather classic and easy, not as grand as those from Alain Ducasse. It was like a tea room in any classic royal palace. The restaurant is situated right next to the jardin. Food: We ordered a 3 courses set lunch, it turned out to be 8 courses with cheese inclusive. Absolutely enough for our lunch. The food was nice, particularly the carrot dish served on the gueridon. The marcaroni with black truffle was a compliment from the chef and it was very delicious. Cheese was so so as the variety was not impressive. Dessert was good but we expected to have the better looking one (same as the profile pic of epicure) The petit four trolley was actually a case with different marcarons. Flavours were good but not as great as Pierre Herme.Wine: We have ordered a bottle of Argrapart et fils 7 crus. This is the only bottle that I found to be reasonably marked up. Well you are in a 3* restaurant in Paris so you cannot expect to have much reasonable choice.Service: Almost tip top, deserved to be 3 star.Environment and ambience: Classy and comfortableWould love to try the dinner next time.;mai-17;Epicure
7;Second experience is 3 star again;5.0;This is my second time to visit this fantastic restaurant. and i met the same servant - Thomas as i did two years ago.this time i ordered some different dished - sole and lamb. both of them are amazing. i love how the chef cook the lamb, fresh and juicy.last time Thomas recommended the chocolate nyangbo, i ordered it again. and this time he recommended another dessert - cherry. impressive!!! cherry with pistachio are well associated with each other, and prefect match!;juin-17;Epicure
7;Wonderful experience in a real 3 Michelin stars restaurant in Paris;5.0;What can I say? Astonishing and gorgeous plates with an extraordinary service...There were many innovative and risky plates, but everything worked out together great.Seasonal menu (lunch) is a great option for not expending that much and having a wonderful experience;oct-16;Epicure
7;Amazing, Amazing, Amazing every course was Amazing;5.0;I now consider this THE BEST RESTAURANT in the world. The flavors are spectacular (indescribable) the service impeccably gracious, the presentation pure artistry. This was an unsurpassed dining experience that repeatedly touched upon perfection. Absolutely STUNNING. The restaurant is a FIVE WOW ! ! ! ! !;juin-17;Epicure
7;Exceeded our expectations.;5.0;I was a little ambivalent given the price point and not all glowing reviews. We also ate at Jules Verne and liked this much better. The food was classic and yummy. The restaurant itself is lovely and service was spot on. They give you plenty of food so skip another meal:) I have been to other top notch restaurants (Guy Savoy, Joel Robuchon). This restaurant is one I'd want to go back to!;mai-17;Epicure
7;Great food!;4.0;One of the best restaurants I've ever visited. Though my wife and I don't speak french, the staff there explained everything to us patiently.If u would like to try new tastes, this is the place for u.;mars-17;Epicure
7;When will there be a menu in Chinese;3.0;We had dinner with my Chinese family, and we were surprised that a restaurant of this quality does not propose a menu in Chinese!There are more than one million Chinese tourists in Paris every year, and the number is permanently growing!When will French high class restaurants will understand that they need to make an effort?Apart from that the dinner was very nice.;mai-17;Epicure
7;Best restaurant in world - including for vegetarians and gluten free!;5.0;"When I decided I wanted to splurge on dinner at the best restaurant in France, I emailed Epicure to ask if they could accommodate vegetarian and gluten-free dietary restrictions. I thought as there really is not veg on the menu, I would get a ""not possible."" Instead we were told ""of course!"" and that it would be figured out on the spot. I was THRILLED! And that was only the beginning of my thrill.We were at Epicure on Saturday May 20 and it was by far the highlight of our time in France. Epicure is not only the best restaurant in the world in general, but they accommodated both our dietary restrictions with UNBELIEVABLE dishes on the spot. The gluten free bread actually brought my friend to tears of joy, and I ordered ""whatever the chef would like to make"" and received the most beautiful meal imaginable. I cannot even start to explain it - even our fantastic server said she was excited to see the main dish as she had never seen it before! On top of the unbelievably delicious meals we all enjoyed (and there were meat eaters, too, who said their meals were fantastic, of course), the care the entire staff takes is remarkable! Everyone was so charming, and so much fun - which I really hadn't expected (I had expected formality, to be honest). I knew I would enjoy the meal, but I was so impressed to have enjoyed the charm of the entire staff, as well. Would you believe they actually made a loaf of their gluten-free bread for my friend to take to go???  Epicure is not just the best restaurant in France - it must be the best restaurant in the world! It is truly remarkable - go and ENJOY!";mai-17;Epicure
7;Not quite as expected;4.0;"We have enjoyed perhaps six other Michelin three star restaurant's in Paris in the past and have been appropriately impressed by the atmosphere, the service and the cuisine. Epicure certainly had a a lovely venue and genuinely gracious service but, in all honesty, the cuisine was less exceptional than expected or warranted at their price point. We would have probably preferred, say Pre Catelan for the venue or Taillevant for the cuisine or Ledoyen for both to the Epicure. Still the warmth of the greeting and the service made the $500 per person billing seem warranted.We really cannot overstate the service which, in Paris, can sometimes can become lost in an attempt at ""professionalism "".";mai-17;Epicure
7;Best evening;5.0;The best restaurant in the world!!!Thank you so much for amazing evening for me and my wife. It was very romantic birthday-dinner. The best service, the best meal, the best atmosphere!!!;mai-17;Epicure
7;As you would expect...perhaps;4.0;I'm conflicted in writing this review. having eaten at a 3 Michelin Star restaurant only once before (Osteria Francescana I came to Epicure with little to compare against. However, having dined at several 2 star establishments and many 1 star restaurants I had at least an inkling.In any event, simply by holding the accolade expectations are already set sky high. the very best ingredients in precision-prepared dishes, presented flawlessly with impeccable service should be a minimum. By that measure, so far so good.But this is where holding 3 stars entitles diners to be extremely picky. Firstly the somewhat strange reception by the maitre'd. I know it's Paris, and an exclusive restaurant in an exclusive hotel (at which we were residents) but the full-length up-and-down look was patronising - I'm generally not bothered by these things - and unwelcome. That said, the service from the waiting staff and sommelier was friendly and unobtrusive. Incidentally I am still baffled by the continued insistence of some restaurants to enforce the gentlemen-must-wear-jackets rule. It's their prerogative of course, but really, in 2017?That however is relatively minor in comparison to the lack of innovation in the dishes, which is my second criticism. We went for the tasting menu in order to get the full experience. There is no doubt that each and every dish is prepared with a great deal of skill and care and that the original creation of the dishes took much thought. Each one was well balance and flavoursome. Again that's a given. But no single dish struck me as being particularly innovative ('safe' springs to mind) and while far from bland, none were outstanding in flavour or surprising in any way.That brings me to my final observation and in a way my biggest disappointment. Such a high quality, labour intensive dining experience in opulent surroundings in one of the world's great capital cities is never going to be cheap. However I see no justification for the price charged at Epicure. I am certainly not price sensitive about these things - in fact I subscribe to the 'reassuringly expensive' school of thought - but this really tested me. To put it in some perspective the next most expensive tasting menu I've experienced was roughly two-thirds of the price (food only that is). I was left feeling that the only reason was the 3-star status and for me that is insufficient justification. Yes it's good, but not that good. Which is a pity because had the price been better aligned to the experience (or vice-versa) then it wouldn't be an issue.;mai-17;Epicure
7;Best Truffle Macaroni;5.0;My fiancée brought us to Epicure for a truly romantic dinner for the end of our stay in Paris!I ordered the truffle macaroni and my fiancée had the langoustine with the yuzu sauce which were both delicious and perfectly balanced. The rest of the meal was sublime.The waiters served us with genuine smiles and were there for our every need.I would love to go back!;mai-17;Epicure
7;Incredible - from start to finish;5.0;My highlight from this dinner was probably the simplicity but complex knowledge of products and the eye for attention from the front of house.The food was excellent and so you should expect from Chef Frechon and his team ! A must try if you are around Paris !!;avr-17;Epicure
7;The Most Enchanting Experience;5.0;"I have never taken the time to write a comment about locations I have been or nights out I have experienced...However on the night of 20th I had the absolute pleasure of visiting Epicure with my better half, from start to finish we had one of the most enchanting evenings I have ever experienced in a fine dining venue and I want to highlight the word ""experience"" because that is exactly what it is, now you might want to read about the food and honestly it's absolute knockout, amazing, creative and a tastebud extravaganza, but for me the people who work there make this simply the greatest venue on the planet, nothing is to much trouble and the ability to make you instantly at ease and lose yourself for the evening is a skill not many have mastered and places worldwide could be educated by...I could keep going on with superlatives, however I will leave you with a just make the booking and visit..you will not be disappointed and you will have the memory of a lifetime.";mai-17;Epicure

7;Worth the wait. An indescribably wonderful experience.;5.0;This was my first Michelin Three Star restaurant. I was astounded. The decor is very traditional French. The service was impeccable. The presentation was stunning. It was simply fantastic.;oct-16;Epicure
7;'Out of this world'-experience!;5.0;Had a reservation for our last night in Paris. The quality of service is unbelievable! It's like a well choreographed dance watching the waiters work.Even thought the food is amazing, (we had the tasting menu) the wines are extraordinary, you come for the whole package. the atmosphere, service, food and drink. If you just look at the price tag, it's way too much money spent, but if you are a sucker for 'out of this world'-experiences, and you are willing to cough up the dough for it, this is definetely for you!Everything was flawless!;avr-17;Epicure
7;Superb in every way;5.0;We traveled to Paris to celebrate our 45th anniversary and dined at L'Epicure. Welcoming, warm, impeccable service and the most amazing meal of our well dined marriage. Special attention to us our celebration as well. Could not have asked for more.;mai-17;Epicure
7;great;5.0;Magnificent place in the heart of Paris. The staff very professional, casual without too much familiarity. The menu very well balanced.;mars-17;Epicure
7;Utmost Delight;5.0;Along with my delightful stay at Hotel Le Bristol, the experience of fine dining at the Epicure was just as delightful.I've described the restaurant in my review of the hotel but to summarize I love the style of this restaurant, which to me is European Provence style with floral motif, lovely. I love the inner court garden with Topiary and green shrubs and flowers...could see this as a lovely reception area for special occasions.Back to the restaurant Epicure...my friends and I all elected the tasting menu but not with wine pairings, since none of us can drink much we just chose a nice bottle of Pinot Noir recommended by the sommelier and do our adventure begins.We didn't really researched so had no expectations other than it's a three starred restaurant and has managed to maintain its ratings.Well, happy to report that to us it's all worthwhile, from the food quality, presentations, and of course service all all lovely. (Pictures)We were very full by the time the petite four came in the form of a carted mirror chest drawers, but managed to try a few of the sweets ... macaroons and chocolates. The prices are as expected, quite pricy but we all thought the value received in the experience was worthwhile. Compared with the two starred La Gabriel nearby it was substantially more value for the bucks. Please do expect about 3 hours for the dinner so note to all, don't do it on the same night of your arrival if you're tired from a long flight. Better to time it on the second night when you had a good rest.;mai-17;Epicure
7;Simply Splendid;5.0;The warm welcome from the Bristol staff, and the beautiful dining room were the prelude to a simply splendid dining experience. You will not experience a stronger commitment to service, and the food is sublime. Over the years, we have sampled the best in Paris haute cuisine, and, in this, our first visit to Epicure, it was as if the Parisian dining experience had been redefined. For those who fear being treated poorly by an imperious staff, we were made to feel as if we were valued guests. For a romantic dinner or a special occasion in this most special of cities, please consider Epicure. Strongly. It is simply splendid.;avr-17;Epicure
7;Elegant and Chic;5.0;Ok this place was my Dad's choice, he wanted a formal dinner and this place was perfect for such purpose. Impecable everything, from service to table setting and of course the food was superb. It is expensive, I believe more than other 3 Michelin star restaurants but it is worth the experience. A little window to a world of pure luxury and VIP treatment.;mai-17;Epicure
7;An exquisite dining experience;5.0;"Entering a three Michelin star restaurant can be a daunting experience, but not so here. The restaurant is formal (jackets required for men) but not stuffy. We were welcomed by the friendly and attentive staff and shown to our table overlooking the beautiful garden courtyard of Le Bristol.We chose to eat here on our first night at the hotel and opted for three courses plus cheese. After a refreshing glass of champagne and amuse-bouche I started with the stuffed macaroni with black truffle and foie gras. It was so gloriously rich that I had to stop half-way through for a break so I could fully savour the strong flavours.For the main course we both had the turbot accompanied by an excellent Chablis. After the rich starter, the fish was the perfect next course, firm, perfectly cooked and with a delightful edge from the red pepper.After a selection of lovely cheeses we both opted for the ""Lemon from Menton"" an amazing meringue dish shaped exactly like a lemon with a limoncello glaze. We had a gorgeous dessert wine, a Muscat, to accompany this dish.After the meal the chef, Eric Frechon, came to speak to us which was a lovely, thoughtful touch.This was without doubt an amazing dining experience, beautiful French food in an elegant setting with ever helpful, friendly, and knowledgeable staff. A perfect end to our first day in Paris";avr-17;Epicure
7;Simply fabulous experience;5.0;Let me start by saying that I have never had a better meal or a more enjoyable evening at a restaurant anywhere. Service was impeccable as was the preparation of our food. I began with caviar, pigeon for my main course, and Bergamote citrus for dessert. The only disappointment was that our doggy bags contained candy instead of macaroons. But too minor to mention. A genuine three-star experience.;mai-17;Epicure
7;Truly An Epicurean Delight in a City renown for excellent dining;5.0;We spent 2 weeks in Paris, during which we tried at least 5-6 different michelin stars restaurants. In our opinion, Epicure (3 Michelin stars) stood out as, by the far, the most memorable one. And this is really saying a lot, considering the level of dining standards in Paris, where in 2 weeks, we never had a single disappointing meal. Epicure is in the exclusive Le Bistrol Hotel. It is elegantly set-up facing the lovely courtyard of the hotel. We had the degustation dinner. Everything about the place was top notch. The service, quality of food, presentation and creativity. So good that we only remembered to take pictures of the food but not of ourselves and the restaurant :). I will post them here and a picture tells a thousand words.If you have to pick only 1 place to dine, I would strongly advice the Epicure.;avr-17;Epicure
7;Delightful;5.0;We decided to drive to Paris from Champagné and I wanted to treat my family to a lunch in this romantic city. Needless to say, it was a memorable gastronomic experience! everything was perfect since we entered the door. Between all what we ate, my favourite were scallops, canneloni and the Nyangbo chocolate. To wash everything down we had a bottle of Chablis Grenouilles Grand Cru, as recommended by the sommelier. The best choice ever! The cheese selection was outstanding too and, again, our sommelier paired them with a sublime dessert wine. The service was extremely discreet and exactly what you'd expect from a top class restaurant.Looking forward to visiting Epicure for another delicious meal the next time we're in Paris!;juin-16;Epicure
7;Heaven on earth;5.0;We had our 15th Anniversary dinner here and it was perfect in every way. I loved my succulent fish and my husband really enjoyed the lamb. And the cheeses are sublime. Yes, it's expensive, but for a special occasion, worth the splurge.;oct-16;Epicure
7;Truly a Great Restaurant in a Great Restaurant City;5.0;On April 9th my wife and I went to Epicure, in the Bristol Hotel in Paris, for our 50th Wedding Anniversary dinner. Epicure is a very special restaurant. It is formal but definitely not stuffy. The room and view of the garden of the hotel is lovely. The staff is quite attentive, proper but not overly so and very pleasant. And it is oh so well staffed. At any moment one can look up and have someone come to the table if you want, they are never far away but never on top of you. As with many a fine restaurant we were started with an amuse. Except that the amuse was 3 different items, all three innovative and interesting. The food is creative, modern French. The wine suggestions, as we ordered by the glass, were excellent.Epicure is not inexpensive. But it is well worth it for a splurge dinner. If you are looking for something very special you will find Epicure meets your expectations.;avr-17;Epicure
7;"""A Delightful Journey from start to finish!""";5.0;We dinned at Epicure on Friday, April 21st for dinner and had the seven course tasting menu. To say the least, our high expectations for the restaurant were completely met. I was able to substitute the artichoke from Provence with the stuffed macaroni and the Bergamote citrus with the lemon from Menton no questions asked! The large langoustines were cooked perfectly with the citrus and mango flavors complimenting each other perfectly. During this trip to Europe, we dined at three 3 starred Michelin restaurants and three 2 starred Michelin restaurants. I would have to say the taste of Chef Frechon's food is right at the top if not the best!! The service at Epicure was also impeccable and very friendly. They really accentuated the dinning experience and made the elegant dinning room feel comfortable and relaxing. This is not something I take for granted after dinning at other highly rated Michelin restaurants. The sommelier Benjamin, recommend a nice bottle of Meursault 2011 that went well with the meal. After stuffing ourselves with the desert trolley, we were even personally greeted by Chef Frechon himself. He didn't speak much, but was very approachable and humble!! We will definitely be coming back to Epicure the next time were are in Paris.;avr-17;Epicure
7;Magical gourmet experience;5.0;"Epicure does everything right - whether it's the attentive, multi-lingual staff, the delicious food, the wonderful selection of wines or the great location within the luxury of the Bristol Hotel. We had a three-course dinner here on the first night of our stay at the Bristol. I started with a glass of Pineau de Charantes and an amazing leek dish with cooked oysters - it was nothing like what I would have thought, absolutely delicious! For my main course I had turbot with a dry cracked red pepper accompaniment and garnish of onion and fennel - it was wonderful, just the right portion size to satisfy without being too heavy.With our meal we had a bottle of ""Grenouille"" Chablis, as recommended by the sommelier - it was excellent, fresh and zesty.The cheese selection is fantastic - I was thoroughly impressed with the nutty Comté, which was even better than what I'm used to (despite the growing availability of Comté in the UK).The dessert was just as impressive as the rest of the meal - a meringue and ice-cream confection shaped like a lemon and drizzled with limoncello! It was beautiful to look at and extremely tasty to eat - especially accompanied by a glass of Muscat de Beaumes de Venise.At the end of the meal (after a cheeky macaron!) the chef came out and asked us how we had enjoyed the meal - a really wonderful touch.This restaurant is a spectacular example of luxury French dining. It's not cheap, of course, but it's worth every penny - I can't praise it highly enough.";avr-17;Epicure
7;Probably the best restaurant experience I am ever likley to have;5.0;We have dined with Heston and tried other 'named' chefs, but this is defintiely the experience that I will remember above all others;mars-17;Epicure
7;Sublime;5.0;What an experience - the food & service were sensational. As soon as we arrived in the hotel we were greeted as long lost friends! Drinks in the bar first - 2 excellent bars to choose from. The amuse bouches were a delight, the salad nicoise one so unexpected. Amazing. The whole evening was an explosion of tastes going on in my mouth! I had a lemon desert which is the BEST desert I've ever eaten! The impeccable service was also a highlight - I've eaten in several Michelin star restaurants and this did not disappoint. A fantastic experience.;avr-17;Epicure
7;The food was excellent, but the staff service was the true highlight;5.0;From the moment I walked into Hotel Le Bristol, to when one of the restaurant staff hailed us a cab home, the service was phenomenal. I was expecting the staff at a three Michelin star restaurant to be extremely formal and maybe a little hoity-toity, but they were unbelievably charming, funny, and pleasant (even when I accidentally stained their white table cloth!) while still being completely professional. They also didn't just lurk around the edges of the room waiting for you to be done. they gave you your space while still being extremely attentive. I would recommend Epicure for their staff service alone.The food was of course everything I expected and more, I mean, it has 3 Michelin stars for a reason. We ordered the chef's selection, which I strongly suggest if you have a few hours (plus the amount of courses makes it worth the cost).The presentation, taste, and quality was nothing less than perfect. I will be sure to have dinner there anytime I find myself in Paris again.;avr-17;Epicure
7;If I could give 10 stars, I would;5.0;"Absolutely best culinary experience of my father and my's life. We emailed in advance to get lunch reservations and knew the experience would be amazing based on their prompt and well-written emails. There are no prices online or on TripAdvisor so I was a bit cautious going in but when we checked in to our hotel, I told the hotel concierge we had reservations and if we should go and his words were ""if you have reservations for Epicure, you must go! It is the best restaurant in Paris if not all of France."" My father said, ""wow! Looks like we are going!""From the moment we walked in, we were blown away. We were both a bit nervous because we thought maybe this was too stuffy for us, but the staff is SO friendly and down to earth... they make you feel a lot better once you speak with them for a little. They do ask ""who is bringing who to dine today"" and my father said I was taking him so they handed me the menu with pricing and him the menu without. This was actually super funny as we both knew he would be paying so we switched menus. No big deal. The second thing I noticed that was different was that they kept wanting us to place our order early on. I kept thinking what in the world, we want to go slow and enjoy the experience... thinking they were trying to turn our table, but is was SEVERELY wrong. They only wanted to know our order so they could prepare our 7 courses (only ordered 3) and get the lunch service going. They had 4 - 5 complimentary dishes for our 4 hour lunch. They didn't turn a table once. Everyone who was there for lunch, was there by 12:30. Yes, it was 4 hours but we truly didn't notice. Neither one of us could believe it was 4pm when we were leaving, we didn't look at our phones once. They food kept coming but it was so perfect that we never felt ""SO FULL"". I hardly really know that they brought as complimentary meals but everything was beyond delicious. As our hotel conceirge said ""if it isn't above your wildest dreams, it wasn't good."" and he was right... it was above our wildest dreams. This meal was truly the best culinary experience of our lives, and I would go back to Paris for this lunch meal alone.";sept-16;Epicure

7;Amazing Culinary Experience;5.0;From the greeting at the door to the handling of the bill, this one of a kind restaurant was an unforgettable experience! Took my wife there while in Paris for our anniversary dinner. and while I had already given her her anniversary gift earlier, they made sure she left with a beautiful rose arrangement on the house! And the way they did it was also amazing!Chef Eric Frechon's creations were out of this world! Every dish was a work of art that tasted like a little piece of heaven! The only drawback was that the evening had to end at a certain point!Absolutely incredible experience!;mai-16;Epicure
7;Unique;5.0;it was so comfortable, warm and inviting and so was the service. And the food was spectacular. You don't hear about this restaurant as much as some of the other Michelin starred ones in Paris. And I think this was one of my favorites. It just had that traditional flair and the food I felt was a stand-out in flavor and presentation. My husband ordered an amazing mashed potato with generous amounts of caviar on top. And I had a stuffed macaroni to start: amazing! The main courses were just as satisfying. they offered different styles of preparation to various fish dishes and asked what I enjoyed. I chose the sole with a Normandy inspired sauce...so delicious and beautiful to look at they way they wrapped it up! This was our final Michelin night (of eight) after a two week stay in France and this still stands out in my mind to be better than most. I highly recommend this restaurant.;janv-17;Epicure
7;Amazing experience and delicious food!;5.0;We were taken to the restaurant by the bar's Maitre D. We were the first customers there so we got to enjoy the view to the gardens and the beautifully decorated room. The service was top notch, literally the BEST we have ever experienced and we have been to many Michelin-star, and famous chef restaurants around the world. All the way through the meal we were treated like high end guests and there was attention to detail in everything! We picked the tasting menu which was filled with all kinds of delicacies, plus a mise en bouche, the entremet and even a wide selection of the most delicious macarons to finish. The chef's version of the macaroni with artichoke, duck foie gras, black truffles and parmesan is soooo worth the hype! Everything was beautifully prepared, presentation on point and most importantly delicious. The sommelier helped us pick delicious wines from the extensive wine list. One in our party did not enjoy the pigeon (just not to his taste) and the Maitre D' insisted to offer him a replacement plate. What really stood out for us was the perfect service all around! At the end of the meal we were invited to tour the kitchen (really impressive!!!) and take a picture with the chef. We loved our experience and will be back in the future!!!;avr-17;Epicure

7;Good Food but Disappointing Service;3.0;We visited Epicure recently to celebrate a milestone birthday. We were expecting great things of both the food and service, however sadly, left the restaurant feeling disappointed with the service in particular.We were served predominately by Diane whose attitude towards us was arrogant and unfriendly. She spoke down to us and was rude when I was presented with a dish containing raw onions (to which I am allergic). She offered no solution and tried to contradict my concern regarding the dish that I was unable to eat. She spent much of her time gossiping with her co-worker, Elodie, which is quite unprofessional for a 3 Star Michelin restaurant. Overall the food was very good and the maître d' demonstrated excellent customer service. subtle and professional. Sadly however, we would not re-visit Epicure if we were to be served by Diane.;mars-17;Epicure
7;Perfect Dinner;5.0;We went for dinner for a celebration of my husband's birthday. The entire experience was amazing. The service was perfectly coordinated. The wine pairings were wonderful (there is not a set pairing option for the tasting menu, but they are willing to provide pairings as desired), and they were willing to accommodate our desire for half-glass pairings. They also agreed to do an appetizer portion of one of the dishes that my husband really wanted as a supplement to the tasting menu. The meal also comes with many little extras, like an amuse bouche and a sweets cart at the end. The cheese course was unbelievable. It is certainly expensive, but if you are willing, it will be an unforgettable dining experience.;janv-17;Epicure

7;C'est fantastique!;5.0;My husband and I dined here during our visit to Paris in March. While we were not surprised that the level of culinary cuisine was at such a high level, or the service impeccable, we were charmed by how lovely the staff was throughout our dinner-informative without condescension, attentive without being suffocating, and a wonderful sense of humor as well. Located in Le Bristol, we were greeted by a hotel representative who walked us to the restaurant. We were seated by a window seat that allowed a view of the garden (would recommend this). We opted to order à la carte as the tasting menu (though delicious) looked like more than we could handle. The two highlights were a grilled fennel (simple, yet amazing) and a salt roasted truffle (interesting and also delicious). Despite our efforts to not over do it, the extras added up to a fair amount of food, but we would not have wanted to miss a bite. Wonderful cheese cart, for those inclined (we were). This meal because of both the food and the lovely staff was one of the highlights of our trip.;mars-17;Epicure
7;Sublime from beginning to end AND a lot of food!;5.0;We just enjoyed a fabulous lunch at Epicure today and I consider it superb value for money! The set menu was 145 Euros per person and they offer a choice of two starters, two main courses and two deserts. We were offered all sorts of nibbles in between. An arrival plate of assorted small bites, followed by an amuse bouche, then our starters, followed by main courses, a small sorbet palate cleanser, a desert and finally the spectacular desert trolley plus mini Madeleine's with coffee. The whole exercise took 3 hours and 15 minutes. The intricacy of each dish was extraordinary and beautifully executed and what made it a 3 star Michelin above all else were the perfect flavor combinations. The restaurant cannot be faulted.;mars-17;Epicure
